This compendium was written to show the methods used to undertake the analyses in the manuscript 
> Timing of triazole-based spray schedules for controlling powdery mildew in Australia: a meta-analysis

This compendium and the accompaning manuscript was authored by [@PaulMelloy](https://www.github.com/PaulMelloy), [@emdelponte](https://www.github.com/emdelponte) and [@adamhsparks](https://www.github.com/adamhsparks).
The analysis makes use of data created by the National Growers Alliance, Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the University of Southern Queensland in Australia.
In the undertaking of this work Paul Melloy was supported by the Western Australia Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) through funding from the Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC), National Disease Modelling Project (DAW1810-007RTX). Additionally, most of the trials featured in this work were also funded by the GRDC.
