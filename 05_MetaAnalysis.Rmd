## Investigating data and the number of factors represented in each trial

### Fungicides

When investigating previous studies into powdery mildew fungicide efficacy on mungbean `r length(unique(PM_MB_means$trial_ref))` trials were found.
However, only eleven tebuconazole were used for the following meta-analysis, followed by the next most common fungicide, propiconazole. Sulphur was disregarded due to its inconsistency in efficacy.

```{r Fungicides}
PM_MB_means %>%
   group_by(fungicide_ai, trial_ref) %>%
   summarise() %>%
   count(sort = TRUE) %>%
   rename(Trials = n) %>%
   kable()

# How many trials do we have if Tebe and Propi are pooled?

```

Tebuconazole and propiconazole might be able to be pooled as a 'triazole' fungicide treatment. 
Amistar Xtra is a combination of azoxystrobin and cyproconazole.
Custodia is a combination of tebuconazole and azoxystrobin.
Perhaps Amistar Xtra and Custodia might be able to be pooled given they both contain strobilurin and triazole, however they contain differing dose ratios (inverted).  

Perhaps best way forward is to do an analysis of only the triazoles. Then do another including azoxystrobin as a comparison.

Preliminary analysis of fungicides show there is a difference the effect of fungicide in proportion of yield saved.

### Fungicide Doses

All trials that used tebuconazole used approximately the same dose.
Dose of the active ingredient ranged from 62.35&nbsp;g per hectare to 60&nbsp;g per hectare. 

```{r Tebe_dose}
PM_MB_means %>%
   filter(fungicide_ai == "tebuconazole") %>%
   select(trial_ref,
          year,
          location,
          first_sign_disease,
          dose_ai.ha,
          total_fungicide) %>%
   kable()
```

### Row spacing

Some experiments were designed to investigate the effect of row spacing and plant density on powdery mildew disease and crop yield.
The results showed that the row spacing had no statistically significant effect on powdery mildew, but narrower rows did increase yield significantly.
Seven trials used a row spacing of 0.75 meters.

```{r row_spacing.m}
PM_MB_means %>%
   filter(fungicide_ai == "tebuconazole") %>%
   group_by(row_spacing.m, trial_ref) %>%
   summarise() %>%
   count() %>%
   rename(Trials = n) %>%
   kable()


PM_MB_means %>%
   filter(fungicide_ai == "propiconazole") %>%
   group_by(row_spacing.m, trial_ref) %>%
   summarise() %>%
   count() %>%
   rename(Trials = n) %>%
   kable()

PM_MB_means %>%
   filter(fungicide_ai == "tebuconazole",
         row_spacing.m == 0.75) 
```

Were there any statistical difference between all row spacing or only some?  
Can we pool certain row spacings that have no significant difference?
From the preliminary analysis, the graphs seem to imply that if there is a lower overall yield there is no effect of row spacing on yield.
However, if the average yield is more than approximately 0.6 - 1 t/ha then smaller row spacing has the potential to provide greater yield.  

### Host genotypes

Host genotype may need to be analysed to determine the effect.

```{r Host_genotype}
PM_MB_means %>%
   filter(fungicide_ai == "tebuconazole",
         row_spacing.m == 0.75) %>%
   group_by(host_genotype, trial_ref) %>%
   summarise() %>%
   count() %>%
   rename(Treatments = n) %>%
   kable()
```
In general the mungbean varieties have the following resistance to powdery mildew.  
   - Berken: Highly susceptible  
   - Crystal: Susceptible  
   - Jade: Moderately susceptible

## Standardising the type of variance  

The type of variance needs to be standardised between trials and treatments for the meta-analysis. 

```{r variance}
PM_MB_means %>%
   filter(fungicide_ai == "tebuconazole",
         row_spacing.m == 0.75) %>%
   group_by(trial_ref, location, y_error.type) %>%
   summarise(tebu_treatments = length(y_error.type))

PM_MB_means %>%
   filter(fungicide_ai == "propiconazole",
          row_spacing.m == 0.75) %>%
   group_by(trial_ref, location, y_error.type) %>%
   summarise(Tebe_Treatments = length(y_error.type))
colnames(PM_MB_means)
```


```{r LSD_trials}
Trials <- PM_MB_means %>%
   filter(fungicide_ai == "tebuconazole",
          row_spacing.m == 0.75,
          y_error.type == "lsd (P=0.05)") %>%
   select(trial_ref) %>%
   distinct()
```


The trial, `mung1112/02` uses Least square differences to describe the variation within the experiment.
The following code attempts to convert this to sampling variance as per the method in [Nugugi et.al (2011)](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/10.1094/PHYTO-08-10-0221).
Ideas for using a T-critical value of 1.697 came from reading a [statisics-how-to website](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/how-to-calculate-the-least-significant-difference-lsd/).
A [table of T-critical values](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/tables/t-distribution-table/) was consulted where 30 degrees of freedom within experiment was used to find the 'T-crit' value of 1.697.

   for (j in seq_along(PM_MB_means[PM_MB_means$trial_ref == Trial2012, ]$replicates)) {
      if (j == 1) {
         Sv <-
            vector(length = length(PM_MB_means[PM_MB_means$trial_ref == Trial2012, ]$replicates))
      }
      #  Sv[j]^2 = MSE/(PM_MB_means[PM_MB_means$trial_ref == Trial2012,]$replicates[j] *
      #                   PM_MB_means[PM_MB_means$trial_ref == Trial2012,]$grain_yield.t.ha[j])
      # Balance equation
      Sv[j] = sqrt(MSE / (
         PM_MB_means[PM_MB_means$trial_ref == Trial2012, ]$replicates[j] *
            as.numeric(PM_MB_means[PM_MB_means$trial_ref == Trial2012, ]$grain_yield.t.ha[j])
      ))
      
   }
   
   # and replacing the values in the dataset
   
   PM_MB_means[PM_MB_means$trial_ref == Trial2012, ]$yield_error <-
      Sv
   PM_MB_means[PM_MB_means$trial_ref == Trial2012, ]$y_error.type <-
      "SamplingVariance"
   
}
```


Now to estimate the variance from the standard deviation

```{r stdev2SampVariance}
# subset data by those which describe the Yield error with standard deviation
Trials <- PM_MB_means %>%
   filter(#fungicide_ai == "tebuconazole",
      #row_spacing.m == 0.75,
      y_error.type == "stdev") %>%
   select(trial_ref) %>%
   distinct()


# calculate the Sampling variance from the standard deviation
# standard error of the mean equals the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of samples
# Sv <- sem^2 <- stdev/sqrt(n)
# Sampling variance eqauls the square of the standard error.
# Sv <- (stdev/sqrt(n))^2

# Therefore

for (j in seq_along(PM_MB_means[PM_MB_means$trial_ref %in% Trials$trial_ref,]$yield_error)) {
   # create empty vector at first iteration with length of j
   if (j == 1) {
      Sv <-
         vector(length = length(PM_MB_means[PM_MB_means$trial_ref %in% Trials$trial_ref,]$yield_error))
   }
   
   # Equation to convert standard deviation to Sampling Variance
   Sv[j] = (PM_MB_means[PM_MB_means$trial_ref %in% Trials$trial_ref,]$yield_error[j]) ^
      2
}



# and replacing the values in the dataset
PM_MB_means[PM_MB_means$trial_ref %in% Trials$trial_ref,]$yield_error <-
   Sv
PM_MB_means[PM_MB_means$trial_ref %in% Trials$trial_ref,]$y_error.type <-
   "SamplingVariance"

```


Now for the trickier part creating 'Sampling Variance' for treatments where only mean yield is recorded.  
The trial which does not report any type of variance also reports that there is no significant difference between the means.
```{r}
NATrials <- PM_MB_means %>%
   filter(fungicide_ai == "tebuconazole",
          row_spacing.m == 0.75,
          is.na(y_error.type)) %>%
   select(trial_ref) %>%
   distinct()
```

A single trial `mung1516/03` within the current scope of the meta-analysis fails to report a variance statistic. According to [Machado F. et. al (2017)](http://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/10.1094/PDIS-03-17-0340-RE) [Paul et. al. (2007)](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1094/PHYTO-97-2-0211) uses linear regression model to estimate sampling variance.

#         subset(PM_MB_means$grain_yield.t.ha[i], fungicide_ai == "tebuconazole")))
# # need to know what parameters a and b are here

# method as described by Emerson
PM_MB_train <- PM_MB_means %>%

PM_MB_train$trial_ref <- as.factor(PM_MB_train$trial_ref)

Lets look at the model without the trial mung1718/01, as it looks to be adding some skew.
```{r lmer_remove_mung1718-01}

PM_MB_train.2 <-
   PM_MB_train[PM_MB_train$trial_ref != "mung1718/01",]


# Rerun the model
PM_MB_trianLMER.5 <- lmer(yield_error ~ `grain_yield.t.ha` +
                             (1 | trial_ref), data = PM_MB_train.2)
summary(PM_MB_trianLMER.5) # no significant effect of mean grain yield on yeild error

   (summary(PM_MB_trianLMER.5)$coef)[2, 1] # Extract the overall mean Slope to predict Yield error

   (summary(PM_MB_trianLMER.5)$coef)[1, 1] # Extract the overall mean intercept to predict Yield error
lmer.coef <-
   coef(PM_MB_trianLMER.5) # extracting the mean random intercept for each of trial variables


# plot the data with the predicted slopes overlayed
ggplot(PM_MB_train.2) +
   geom_point(aes(y = yield_error, x = `grain_yield.t.ha`, colour = trial_ref)) +
   geom_abline(
      intercept = c(InterC, lmer.coef$trial_ref[, 1]),
      slope = c(paramA, lmer.coef$trial_ref[, 2]),
      size = 1,
      colour = c("Black", hue_pal()(10))
   ) +
   coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 0.33))

```




Just for kicks lets look at the linear regression model as a Random effects model where `grain_yield.t.ha` is set as a random slope to the random intercept `trial_ref`.  
The model fits better as shown by an ANOVA comparison. But how to impute from this model if mean variance for a trial is unknown....
```{r random_slope_model}


# Run a linear model with Yield error as a fixed effect predictor and Trial as a random intercept
PM_MB_trianLMERx <- lmer(yield_error ~ 1 +
                            (`grain_yield.t.ha` | trial_ref), data = PM_MB_train)

anova(PM_MB_trianLMER, PM_MB_trianLMERx) # random slope model NOT significantly better # P = 0.6677

summary(PM_MB_trianLMERx)

InterC <-
   (summary(PM_MB_trianLMER)$coef)[1, 1] # Extract the overall mean intercept

lmer.coefx <- coef(PM_MB_trianLMERx)

# plot of the mixed effect model, Black line shows the mean lmer regression line
ggplot(PM_MB_train) +
   geom_point(aes(y = yield_error, x = `grain_yield.t.ha`, colour = trial_ref)) +
   geom_abline(
      intercept = lmer.coefx$trial_ref[, 2],
      slope = lmer.coefx$trial_ref[, 1],
      size = 1,
      colour = hue_pal()(11)
   ) +
   coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 3),
                   ylim = c(0, 1))
```


After much deliberation I don't think this is possible to use the model with grain yield/ha as a random slope. Even though we know the grain yields and the mean in the grain yields we still can't predict the effect of the random intercept trial on the yield error.  
I also re-ran the model without including the trial which we used LSD to interpret the sampling variance and the model lost a lot of significance.  



Emerson proposed I look at the between trial variation

   )
