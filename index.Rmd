# Home

This research compendium details the statistical analysis and methods of a meta-analysis of fungicide efficacy trials for controlling powdery mildew in mungbean.
The meta-analysis's main aim is to determine:

> When is the optimum time to spray fungicide to limit the effect of powdery mildew on mungbean yields?  

## Contents
This compendium is broken down into seven sections:

      b. [Import data][Import data]
      c. [Trial summary][Summary of all trials]
      d. [Locations of considered trials][Experiment locations]
      e. [Apply selection criteria][Subset data to selection criteria]
      f. [Classifing moderator variable - spray schedule][Classifying spray schedule]
      g. [Identifing treatment variance][Identify variance]
   2. [Preliminary data exploration which investigates possible variables that could influence the meta-analysis][Preliminary Analysis]  
      a. [Fungicides][Fungicides]  
      b. [Mungbean cultivar][Mungbean cultivars]  
      c. [Row spacing][Row spacing]  
      d. [Rainfall][Yield vs in-season rain]  
      e. [When conditions become suitable for powdery mildew infection][Season range and first incidence]

   7. [Manuscript: A meta-analysis of fungicide use in mungbean to control for yield loss due to powdery mildew.][Manuscript]

## Other research questions, which are not the focus of this study

+ How has the first sign of powdery mildew changed between the seasons and experimental sites?

+ Is there an ideal planting time, or fungicide management strategy, which could make use of powdery mildew defoliation during pod maturation resulting in an increased yield?

+ Do infections that occur before flowering increase the probable yield loss?

## Possible sources of variation in this analysis.

+ Variability among host genotypes.

   + The probable influence of season might be influenced by host genotype.
   This is because newer varieties were adopted into experimental trials as they were released.
   
   + Between 2001 and 2015 mungbean genotype changed from Green Diamond, Berken, Crystal to Jade.
   Jade was the only cultivar used between 2015 and 2019.
   
   + Estimations of plant maturity stages over each growing season.
    These estimations might able to be computed using APSIM.
