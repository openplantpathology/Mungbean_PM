# Research questions

What is the length of a Mungbean season and how has it varied in this trial

How has the first sign of powdery mildew changed over the seasons and between experimental sites. 

When is the optimum time to spray fungicide to limit the impact of powdery mildew on mungbean yeilds.  

When would the ideal planting time be to make use of powdery mildew defoliation in the final growth of the crop.  

Do infections that occur before flowering increase the probable yield loss?

## parts fof analysis that need checking

Variability among host genotypes and probable influence of season given that over the years, the genotype studied changed from Berken, Crystal to Jade.
