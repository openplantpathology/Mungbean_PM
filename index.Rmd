# Home

This compendium details the statistical analysis and methods while undertaking a meta-analysis of fungicide efficacy trials for control of powdery mildew in mungbean. 
This meta-analysis will focus on the main aim of determining:

> When is the optimum time to spray fungicide to limit the effect of powdery mildew on mungbean yields?

## Other research questions which are not the focus of this study
+ How has the first sign of powdery mildew changed over the seasons and between
experimental sites?  

+ Is there an ideal planting time, or fungicide management strategy, which could
make use of powdery mildew defoliation during pod maturation resulting in an
increased yield?  

+ Do infections that occur before flowering increase the probable yield loss?  

+ What is the length of a mungbean season and how has it varied in this trial?  

   - This data has not been collected or is not accurate enough to be useful to
   answer this question.  


## Possible sources of variation in this analysis.

+ Variability among host genotypes.  
   + The probable influence of season might be influenced by host genotype. This
   is because newer varieties were adopted into experimental trials as they were
   released.  
   
   + Between 2001 and 2015 mungbean genotype changed from Green Diamond, Berken,
   Crystal to Jade. Jade was the only cultivar used between 2015 and 2019.  
   
   + Estimations of plant maturity stages over each growing season. These
   estimations might able to be computed using APSIM.
