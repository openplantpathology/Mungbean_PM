This research compendium details the statistical analysis and methods of a meta-analysis of fungicide efficacy trials for controlling powdery mildew in mungbean.
The meta-analysis's main aim is to determine:

> When is the optimum time to spray fungicide to limit the effect of powdery mildew on mungbean yields?  

## Contents
This compendium is broken down into four sections:  

   1. [Details of the experiments, and application of inclusion criteria in the analysis][Trials considered for inclusion in meta-analysis]  
   2. [Preliminary data exploration][Preliminary Analysis]  
   *including a summary of the cleaned trial data and the treatments*
   3. [Grain yield meta-analysis]  
   4. [Powdery mildew severity Meta-analysis]  
         
These sections detail the methods and process we undertook during this meta-analysis.
