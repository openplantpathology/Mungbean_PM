### Yield saved from fungicide applications  

The data plotted below are from the past field trials (2011 - 2017) described in the aforementioned table. All data are a list of mean values from each treatment applied in each experiment. Various factors have been studied in the previous experiments which may influence the following results. The following variables were disregarded in the plots below.

   1) Fungicide type
   2) Fungicide dose
   3) row spacing
   4) Host cultivars
   5) Experiment location
   6) Final disease rating
