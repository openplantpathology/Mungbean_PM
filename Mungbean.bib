abstract = {Both restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses were employed to map a new source of resistance to powdery mildew in mungbean. Disease scores of an F2 population derived from the cross between a moderately resistant breeding line VC1210A and a susceptible wild relative (Vigna radiata var. sublobata, accession TC1966) showed a continuous distribution and was treated as a quantitative trait. Although no significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) that can explain the variation was detected by QTL analysis based on the reconstructed RFLP linkage map, new marker loci associated with resistance were discovered by AFLP analysis. The RFLP loci detected by two of the cloned AFLP bands are associated with resistance and constitute a new linkage group. A major resistance quantitative trait locus was found on this linkage group that accounted for 64.9{\%} of the variation in resistance to powdery mildew. One of the probes developed in this study has the potential to assist in breeding for powdery mildew resistance in mungbean.},

abstract = {Avoid paddocks with a history of Fusarium wilt in mungbean. Plant seed into well-drained soils and minimise plant stress. To minimise the risk of halo blight and tan spot: use low risk planting seed, plant varieties with higher levels of resistance, clean harvesting equipment, control weeds and volunteers, and use suitable crop rotations. Report phytoplasma disease outbreaks to Qld DAF Entomologists and Plant Pathologists. Timely fungicide applications of Folicur{\textregistered} (PER13979 – expires 30th June 2017; application for extension submitted, pending approval) or Custodia{\textregistered} (PER82104 – expires 30th November 2019) are effective at managing powdery mildew in mungbean. For Folicur, crops should be sprayed at the first sign of disease and then again 14 days later if necessary, with a maximum of three applications per crop. For Custodia, do not apply more than three foliar applications per season with a minimum retreatment interval of 10 to 14 days Sorghum stubble is a good reservoir for Fusarium thapsinum to survive between sorghum crops. Level of F. thapsinum in sorghum stubble starts to decline after two months with standing stubble treatments appearing to decline at a slower rate than surface and buried treatments. By 18 months, F. thapsinum levels appear to be similar across all stubble treatments. PREDICTA B test for Macrophomina phaseolina is under evaluation.},

@article{Chankaew2013,
abstract = {Powdery mildew (PM) is a common and serious disease of mungbean [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek]. A few quantitative trait loci (QTL) for PM resistance in mungbean have been reported. The objective of this study was to locate QTL for PM resistance in two resistant accessions V4718 and RUM5. Simple sequence repeat markers were analyzed in an F2 population from a cross between Kamphaeng Saen 1 (KPS1; susceptible to PM) and V4718 (resistant to PM), and in F2 and BC1F1 populations from a cross between Chai Nat 60 (CN60; susceptible to PM) and RUM5 (resistant to PM). Progenies of 134 F2:3 and F2:4 lines derived from KPS1 × V4718, and 190 F2:3 and 74 BC1F1:2 lines derived from CN60 × RUM5 and CN60 × (CN60 × RUM5), respectively, were evaluated for response to PM under field conditions. Multiple interval mapping identified a major QTL on linkage group (LG) 9 and two minor QTL on LG4 for the resistance in V4718, and detected two major QTL on LG6 and LG9 and one minor QTL on LG4 for the resistance in RUM5. Comparative linkage analysis of the QTL for PM resistance in this study and in previous reports suggests that the resistance QTL on LG9 in V4718, RUM5, ATF3640 and VC6468-11-1A are the same locus or linked. One QTL on LG4 is the same in three sources (V4718, RUM5 and VC1210A). Another QTL on LG6 is the same in two sources (RUM5 and VC6468-11-1A). In addition, one QTL in V4718 on LG4 appears to be a new resistance locus. These different resistance loci will be useful for breeding durably PM-resistant mungbean cultivars. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

@article{Pandey2018,
abstract = {Mungbean (Vigna radiata var. radiata) is a key legume crop grown predominantly in South and Southeast Asia. Biotic and abiotic stresses cause significant yield reduction in mungbean, and among these, fungal diseases are particularly important. Although disease management practices, including physical, chemical, and biological methods have been researched and described in the literature, few of these are available or have been used by growers. Here we review the economic impact, pathogen characterization, and sustainable management options for the soil-borne and foliar fungal diseases of mungbean as well as major challenges to manage these diseases. Potential use of all possible components of integrated management practices including host resistance, fungicides, biocontrol agents, natural plant products, and cultural practices etc. are discussed. Major diseases include powdery mildew, anthracnose, Cercospora leaf spot, Fusarium wilt, Rhizoctonia root rot and web blight, Macrophomina charcoal rot/dry root rot and blight. Review of the literature indicated an absence of resistance to Rhizoctonia root rot, little sources of resistance for dry root rot and anthracnose. Major resistant genes (R genes) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified for powdery mildew and Cercospora leaf spot, which may be potentially used in Marker assisted selection (MAS). has been used in resistance breeding for both of the latter. Although the mechanisms of induced systemic resistance (ISR) by biocontrol agents have been studied with Macrophomina blight, there is little information on the mechanisms and use of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in managing fungal diseases of mungbean. Several studies targeted exploiting biological control for soil-borne root rot diseases. Botanical products, such as plant extracts, are also found effective to manage root and foliar diseases. However, many of these studies were limited to laboratory and/or green house experiments. Thus, long-term field studies are required for further exploitation of biological methods and commercial applications.},
