  abstract = {Photosynthetic activity of cereals has traditionally been studied using leaves, thus neglecting the role of other organs such as ears. Here, we studied the effects of water status and genotypes on the photosynthetic activity of the flag leaf blade and the ear of durum wheat. The various parameters related to the photosynthetic activity were analysed in relation to the total above-ground plant biomass and grain yield at maturity. Four local varieties plus two cultivars adapted to the semiarid areas of South Morocco were grown in pots in a greenhouse. Five different water treatments were maintained from the beginning of stem elongation to maturity, when shoot biomass and grain yield were recorded. The net photosynthesis (A), stomatal conductance (g(s)) and transpiration (T) of the ear and the flag leaf were measured at anthesis. In both organs these factors decreased significantly with water deficit, whereas the A/T and A/g(s) ratios increased. The genotype effect was also significant for all traits studied. Whole-organ photosynthesis was much higher in the ear than in the flag leaf in well-watered conditions. As water stress developed, photosynthesis decreased less in the ear than in the flag leaf. Whole-ear photosynthesis correlated better than flag leaf photosynthesis with biomass and yield. Nevertheless, the relationships of the whole flag leaf with biomass and yield improved as the water stress became more severe, suggesting a progressive shift of yield from sink to source limitation. For all water regimes the ratios A/g(s) and A/T of the ear also showed a higher ( negative) correlation with both biomass and yield than those of the flag leaf. The results indicate that the ear has a greater photosynthetic role than the flag leaf in determining grain yield, not only in drought but also in the absence of stress.},

  abstract = {A PCR assay based on a pair of oligonucleotide primers targeting the 16S and 23S rRNA genes was used to detect Fusarium oxy- sporum f. sp. vasinfectum (Fov), a fungus causing Fusarium wilt of cotton, in infected cotton seedlings. By using the primer pair Fov1-Eg-f and Fov1-Eg-r, a 438-bp DNA fragment was consistent- ly amplified from 41 Egyptian isolates of Fov (race 3), while no amplification was obtained from template genomic DNAs ob- tained from other fungal pathogens, namely F. oxysporum, F. solani, F. verticillioides, F. sambucinum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Macrophomina phaseolina. PCR product of the expected size was amplified from as little as 100 fg of purified Fov genomic DNA. The sensitivity of real-time PCR allowed detection of 200 fg of target genomic DNA. The melting temperature (Tm) values of Fov isolates were in the range 86.83 to 87.02. Fov DNA was de- tected in infected cotton roots, while no amplification was ob- tained from other plant structures, such as stem and leaf. The re- al-time PCR assay successfully detected Fov and correlated well with assessments based on conventional PCR techniques. The application of this technique will be useful for identification of Fov in infected cotton roots and detection of Fov in infected plants that lack visible morphological structures or symptoms.},

  abstract  = {Plutella xylostella granulovirus (PlxyGV) has been isolated from insect populations in many countries and is considered a potential biopesticide for sustainable control of P. xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae). Several PlxyGV isolates have been genetically characterised, and the full genome se-quence of PlxyGV-Japan is available for comparison with novel isolates. A South African PlxyGV was recently recovered from an overcrowded laboratory P. xylostella colony and identified as a genetically distinct isolate by sequencing of the granulin gene and restriction endonuclease (REN) analysis of genomic DNA. In this report, PlxyGV-SA was further charac-terised by PCR amplification and sequencing of egt, lef-8 and lef-9 genes, and several amino acid substi-tutions were observed. The PstI REN profile of PlxyGV-SA was different from that of PlxyGV-Japan in terms of band size and number, thereby confirming its novel genetic identity. Surface dose bioassays showed that PlxyGV-SA is pathogenic to neonate but not late instar larvae at the same and higher virus doses, indicating that a biopesticide should be targeted at early larval stages in the field.},

Also, a clear preference for linted cotton seeds was evident in walking T.{}castaneum, especially in small-scale arenas in the laboratory, where at least 60{\%} of beetles released preferred linted cotton seeds over wheat and sorghum. Similarly, in cages (1{}m3) they responded five times more strongly to linted cotton seed than to conventional grain resources. However, this pattern was not consistent with those obtained from field trapping over 20{}m and the beetles did not show any particular preference to any of the resources tested above. Our results suggest a focus on walking beetles in trapping studies for population estimations and, for developing effective food-based trapping lures, the potential use of active volatiles from the fungi associated with linted cotton seed.},

  abstract = {A rising global population and demand for protein-rich diets are increasing pressure to maximize agricultural productivity. Rising atmospheric [CO2] is altering global temperature and precipitation patterns, which challenges agricultural productivity. While rising [CO2] provides a unique opportunity to increase the productivity of C-3 crops, average yield stimulation observed to date is well below potential gains. Thus, there is room for improving productivity. However, only a fraction of available germplasm of crops has been tested for CO2 responsiveness. Yield is a complex phenotypic trait determined by the interactions of a genotype with the environment. Selection of promising genotypes and characterization of response mechanisms will only be effective if crop improvement and systems biology approaches are closely linked to production environments, that is, on the farm within major growing regions. Free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments can provide the platform upon which to conduct genetic screening and elucidate the inheritance and mechanisms that underlie genotypic differences in productivity under elevated [CO2]. We propose a new generation of large-scale, low-cost per unit area FACE experiments to identify the most CO2-responsive genotypes and provide starting lines for future breeding programmes. This is necessary if we are to realize the potential for yield gains in the future.},

Data from 120 primary, peer-reviewed articles describing physiology and production in the 12 large-scale FACE experiments (475-600 ppm) were collected and summarized using meta-analytic techniques. The results confirm some results from previous chamber experiments: light-saturated carbon uptake, diurnal C assimilation, growth and above-ground production increased, while specific leaf area and stomatal conductance decreased in elevated [CO(2)]. There were differences in FACE. Trees were more responsive than herbaceous species to elevated [CO(2)]. Grain crop yields increased far less than anticipated from prior enclosure studies. The broad direction of change in photosynthesis and production in elevated [CO(2)] may be similar in FACE and enclosure studies, but there are major quantitative differences: trees were more responsive than other functional types; C(4) species showed little response; and the reduction in plant nitrogen was small and largely accounted for by decreased Rubisco. The results from this review may provide the most plausible estimates of how plants in their native environments and field-grown crops will respond to rising atmospheric [CO(2)]; but even with FACE there are limitations, which are also discussed.},

  abstract = {To establish the identity of Fusarium species associated with head blight (FHB) and crown rot (CR) of wheat, samples were collected from wheat paddocks with different cropping history in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales during 2001. CR was more widespread but FHB was only evident in northern NSW and often occurred with CR in the same paddock. Twenty different Fusarium spp. were identified from monoconidial isolates originating from different plant parts by using morphology and species-specific PCR assays. Fusarium pseudograminearum constituted 48{\%} of all isolates and was more frequently obtained from the crown, whereas Fusarium graminearum made up 28{\%} of all isolates and came mostly from the head. All 17 Fusarium species tested caused FHB and all 10 tested caused CR in plant infection assays, with significant (P {\textless} 0.001) difference in aggressiveness among species and among isolates within species for both diseases. Overall, isolates from stubble and crown were more aggressive for CR, whereas isolates from the flag leaf node were more aggressive for FHB. Isolates that were highly aggressive in causing CR were those originating from paddocks with wheat following wheat, whereas those from fields with wheat following maize or sorghum were highly aggressive for FHB. Although 20{\%} of isolates caused severe to highly severe FHB and CR, there was no significant (P {\textless} 0.32) correlation between aggressiveness for FHB and CR. Given the ability of F. graminearum to colonise crowns in the field and to cause severe CR in bioassays, it is unclear why this pathogen is not more widely distributed in Australia.},

Even if F. fujikuroi is the most abundant Fusarium species found on rice, other species can also be isolated from rice, such as F. proliferatum. Multiple alignment of translation elongation factor (TEF) gene sequences of different Fusarium spp., showed a deletion of six nucleotides in F. fujikuroi sequence and a two nucleotide polymorphism in the same region of F. proliferatum sequence. These elements of variability were used to develop a conventional and Real-Time PCR assay for diagnosis. The species specific primer pairs (Fuji1F/TEF1R and Proli1F/TEF1R) gave a product of 179 and 188 bp for F. fujikuroi and F. proliferatum respectively. Primer specificity was confirmed by analyzing the DNA of the most representative species of the GFSC and 298 strains of Fusarium spp. isolated from rice plants and seeds in Italy. The specific primers were also successfully used to detect fungal presence directly from infected rice tissues and seeds, providing a rapid tool for the early detection of pathogen contamination.},

It explores the evolution of the major types of plant defence responses including pathogen associated molecular patterns and effector triggered immunity as well as the forces driving pathogen evolution, such as the mechanisms by which pathogen lineages and species evolve. Advances in our understanding of plant defence signalling, stomatal regulation, R gene--effector interactions and host specific toxins are used to highlight recent insights into the coevolutionary arms race between pathogens and plants. Finally, the review considers the intriguing question of how plants have evolved the ability to distinguish friends such as rhizobia and mycorrhiza from their many foes.},

Synthesis of these compounds is tightly controlled through regulatory networks. These networks act in response to the environmental conditions in which the fungus grows. One class of fungal secondary metabolites that have drawn increased attention, is the polyketides produced by a high number of fungi and bacteria. The increasing number of publicly available genomic sequences of filamentous fungi, combined with new and highly efficient DNA-cloning techniques, has allowed the use of new efficient approaches to study the regulation and synthesis of these compounds. With the availability of new molecular genetic tools, a new bottleneck has occurred in fungal molecular biology; the analytical chemical analysis of the generated transgenic mutants. In this study, a method based on PARAFAC data analysis of HPLC data is presented and shown useful for gaining overview of complex and diverse datasets. Further, the strain specific and nutrient dependent regulation of polyketide synthesis is discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The Fusarium mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) can cause cell death in wheat (Triticum aestivum), but can also reduce the level of cell death caused by heat shock in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cell cultures. We show that 10 mu g mL(-1) DON does not cause cell death in Arabidopsis cell cultures, and its ability to retard heat-induced cell death is light dependent. Under dark conditions, it actually promoted heat-induced cell death. Wheat cultivars differ in their ability to resist this toxin, and we investigated if the ability of wheat to mount defense responses was light dependent. We found no evidence that light affected the transcription of defense genes in DON-treated roots of seedlings of two wheat cultivars, namely cultivar CM82036 that is resistant to DON-induced bleaching of spikelet tissue and cultivar Remus that is not. However, DON treatment of roots led to genotype-dependent and light-enhanced defense transcript accumulation in coleoptiles. Wheat transcripts encoding a phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) gene (previously associated with Fusarium resistance), non-expressor of pathogenesis-related genes-1 (NPR1) and a class III plant peroxidase (POX) were DON-upregulated in coleoptiles of wheat cultivar CM82036 but not of cultivar Remus, and DON-upregulation of these transcripts in cultivar CM82036 was light enhanced. Light and genotype-dependent differences in the DON/DON derivative content of coleoptiles were also observed. These results, coupled with previous findings regarding the effect of DON on plants, show that light either directly or indirectly influences the plant defense responses to DON.},

Fusarium pseudograminearum can be distinguished from F. graminearum based on difference in colony growth rates, region of conidia with greatest width, different reactions to near-ultraviolet black-light-blue light concerning the length of 3- and 5-septate conidia, and absence of homothallic production of perithecia. Maximum parsimony analysis of DNA sequences from the beta-tubulin gene introns and exons indicate that F. pseudograminearum represents a phylogenetically distinct species that is a sister group to a F. graminearum-F. lunulosporum-F. culmorum clade. DNA sequence data from the translation elongation factor gene were used to develop a polymerase chain reaction primer pair which specifically amplified DNA from all isolates of Fusarium pseudograminearum tested.},

  abstract = {While photosynthesis of C3 plants is stimulated by an increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration, photosynthetic capacity is often reduced after long-term exposure to elevated CO2. This reduction appears to be brought about by end product inhibition, resulting from an imbalance in the supply and demand of carbohydrates. A review of the literature revealed that the reduction of photosynthetic capacity in elevated CO2 was most pronounced when the increased supply of carbohydrates was combined with small sink size. The volume of pots in which plants were grown affected the sink size by restricting root growth. While plants grown in small pots had a reduced photosynthetic capacity, plants grown in the field showed no reduction or an increase in this capacity. Pot volume also determined the effect of elevated CO2 on the root/shoot ratio: the root/shoot ratio increased when root growth was not restricted and decreased in plants grown in small pots. The data presented in this paper suggest that plants growing in the field will maintain a high photosynthetic capacity as the atmospheric CO2 level continues to rise.},

  abstract = {With current annual production at over 600 million tonnes, wheat is the third largest crop in the world behind corn and rice, and an essential source of carbohydrates for millions of people. While wheat is grown over a wide range of environments, it is common in the major wheat-producing countries for grain filling to occur when soil moisture is declining and temperature is increasing. Average global temperatures have increased over the last decades and are predicted to continue rising, along with a greater frequency of extremely hot days. Such events have already been reported for major wheat growing regions in the world. However, the direct impact of past temperature variability and changes in averages and extremes on wheat production has not been quantified. Attributing changes in observed yields over recent decades to a single factor such as temperature is not possible due to the confounding effects of other factors. By using simulation modelling, we were able to separate the impact of temperature from other factors and show that the effect of temperature on wheat production has been underestimated. Surprisingly, observed variations in average growing-season temperatures of +/- 2 degrees C in the main wheat growing regions of Australia can cause reductions in grain production of up to 50{\%}. Most of this can be attributed to increased leaf senescence as a result of temperatures {\textgreater} 34 degrees C. Temperature conditions during grain filling in the major wheat growing regions of the world are similar to the Australian conditions during grain filling. With average temperatures and the frequency of heat events projected to increase world-wide with global warming, yield reductions due to higher temperatures during the important grain-filling stage alone could substantially undermine future global food security. Adaptation strategies need to be considered now to prevent substantial yield losses in wheat from increasing future heat stress.},

The model was used to simulate above- and belowground growth, grain yield, water and N uptake, and soil water and soil N in wheat crops in Western Australia. Model outputs were compared with detailed field experiments from four rainfall zones, three soil types, and five wheat genotypes. The field experiments covered 10 seasons, with variations in sowing date, plant density, N fertiliser, deep ripping and irrigation. The overall APSIM model predictions of shoot growth, root depth, water and N uptake, soil water, soil N, drainage and nitrate leaching were found to be acceptable. Grain yields were well predicted with a coefficient of determination r2(1:1)=0.77, despite some underestimation during severe terminal droughts. Yields tended to be underestimated during terminal droughts due to insufficient pre-anthesis stored carbohydrates being remobilised to the grain. Simulation of grain protein, and depth to the perched water table showed limited accuracy when compared with field measurements. In particular, grain protein tended to be overpredicted at high protein levels and underpredicted at low levels. However, specific simulation studies to predict biomass, yield, drainage and nitrate leaching are now possible for wheat crops on the tested soil types and rainfall zones in Western Australia.},

  abstract = {Spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Klaxon) plants were exposed to mixtures of SO2 + NO2 (at concentrations of 24-35 nl l-1 of each gas, depending upon fumigation system), or to charcoal-filtered, or unfiltered ambient air during the period in which the second, and subsequent, leaves were emerging. The ability of individual detached leaves to regulate water loss was then examined after terminating the pollutant treatment. Observations of diurnal changes in stomatal resistance of well-watered plants, using a viscous flow porometer, failed to indicate any major alterations which could be attributed to prior exposure to SO2 + NO2. By contrast, when an ABA solution (10(-1) mol m-3) was applied to detached leaves, the stomata of polluted plants were less responsive than plants previously exposed to control air. The dynamics of the observed responses strongly implicated impaired physiology of the guard cells rather than mechanical changes in the epidermis that might, for example, result from damage to the cuticle. Stomatal closure was considerably slower in polluted leaves compared with the controls. This decline in responsiveness to ABA was observed using leaves excised from well-watered plants and in the absence of any externally visible injury. The ability of stomata to respond to a range of CO2 concentrations from 195-735-mu-mol mol-1 was also examined using individual leaves, attached to the plant, in an environmentally controlled cuvette. Here the stomata of leaves which had been fumigated with SO2 + NO2 behaved in a similar manner to the non-fumigated leaves, both showing closure in elevated CO2 concentrations.},

  abstract = {The mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON), produced by several Fusarium spp., acts as a virulence factor and is essential for symptom development after initial wheat infection. Accumulating evidence shows that the production of this secondary metabolite can be triggered by diverse environmental and cellular signals, implying that it might have additional roles during the life cycle of the fungus. Here, we review data that position DON in the saprophytic fitness of Fusarium, in defense and in the primary C and N metabolism of the plant and the fungus. We combine the available information in speculative models on the role of DON throughout the interaction with the host, providing working hypotheses that await experimental validation. We also highlight the possible impact of control measures in the field on DON production and summarize the influence of abiotic factors during processing and storage of food and feed matrices. Altogether, we can conclude that DON is a very important compound for Fusarium to cope with a changing environment and to assure its growth, survival, and production of toxic metabolites in diverse situations.},

but pathogens still claim 10--16{\%} of the global harvest. We consider the effect of climate change on the many complex biological interactions affecting pests and pathogen impacts and how they might be manipulated to mitigate these effects. Integrated solutions and international co-ordination in their implementation are considered essential. Providing a background on key constraints to food security, this overview uses fusarium head blight as a case study to illustrate key influences of climate change on production and quality of wheat, outlines key links between plant diseases, climate change and food security, and highlights key disease management issues to be addressed in improving food security in a changing climate.},
  annote    = {Food security can be defined as {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life'' (FAO, 2003) or {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}fair prices, choice, access through open and competitive markets, continuous improvements in food safety, transition to healthier diets, and a more environmentally sustainable food chain'' (Anonymous, 2008a), although a simpler definition could be {\textquoteleft}the risk of adequate food not being available'. It is a combination of multiple food availability, food access and food utilization issues The {\textquoteleft}fertilization effect' of increasing CO2 increases crop biomass and grain yield (Ainsworth{\&}Long, 2005), raising the possibility of increased food production.However, emerging evidence of reduced grain yield from high temperature and water limitations (Anwar et al., 2007; Torriani et al., 2007) make a wholesale increase in crop productivity unlikely. Also, the impacts of plant diseases, mostly ignored in assessments of global food security under climate change, minimize or reverse any benefit from the CO2 fertilization effect (Fernandes et al., 2004; Butterworth et al., 2010) The FAO estimated that 1{\AE}02 billion people went hungry in 2009, the highest ever level of world hunger,mainly as a result of declining investment in agriculture (Anonymous, 2010) Conditions will be evenmore difficult if climate change results in melting of portions of the Himalayan glaciers, disturbs the monsoon pattern and increases flooding / drought in Asia, as this will affect 25{\%} of the world's cereal production through increased uncertainty over the availability of water for irrigation and more frequent floods affecting lives and livelihoods. will the yield loss be the same for a necrotroph and a biotroph under two different available nitrogen levels, and will this relationship remain the same with increased CO2 and temperature? Will a drought or heat stress affect both in the same way? Furthermore, any such relationships may be specific to particular crops, environments or agronomic regimes. However, whilst in natural ecological communities we might expect these to be acquired by normal natural selection processes, in agricultural systems different traits may be prioritized as crops are grown in intra- rather than inter-genotypic competition and thus have lost functional diversity (Newton et al., 2009). In such monocultures, the use of major genes for resistance to pathogens is likely to lead to strong selection on pathogen populations to overcome them (Pangga et al., 2011) whereas in heterogeneous communities it may lead to stability (e.g. Huang et al., 1994) Compared with wild plants, crops have had their developmental cycle changed to enhance yield, for example by producing larger fruiting bodies or larger grain sizes, making the assimilate-remobilization phase more vulnerable to pest and pathogen attack (Newton et al., 2010a) However, we should ideally be breeding for and managing {\textquoteleft}ecological tolerance', since managing levels of pathogens that cause little yield loss is likely to be a far more robust control strategy than trying to eliminate all pathogens (Newton et al., 2010b). Given the likelihood of a more variable climate with more frequent extreme weather events (Pachauri {\&} Reisinger, 2007), there is likely to be a trend towards limiting crop geoclimatic distributions to the low-risk areas away from the high-risk areas Wheat is the most important source of carbohydrate (Curtis et al., 2002) providing, on average, one-fifth of the total calorific input of the world's population and half the total dietary calories in regions such as North Africa, Turkey and Central Asia (Reynolds et al., 2008). Wheat is processed into many end products to provide for sophisticated consumers and grain quality increasingly influences international grain trading (Blakeney et al., 2009). About half the global wheat area of {\textgreater}200 million hectares is in less developed countries where there have been steady increases in productivity from genetic improvements in yield potential, resistance to diseases, adaptation to abiotic stresses and better agronomic practices. The quantitative relationships between weather, cropping practices and mycotoxin concentrations (Champeil et al., 2004) form the basis of mycotoxin forecasts such as DONCAST (Schaafsma {\&} Hooker, 2007). In general, the potential for high concentrations of mycotoxin in grains generally increases with the number of rainy days and days with relative humidity {\textgreater}75{\%}, but decreases with temperature 32 C (Schaafsma {\&} Hooker, 2007). Fusarium culmorum and Microdochium nivale have been the prevalent species in cooler temperate climates of Europe, but in the last decade F. graminearum has become the dominant species causing FHB in the Netherlands (Waalwijk et al., 2003), England and Wales (Jennings et al., 2004) and northern Germany (Miedaner et al., 2008), because its higher temperature optimum favours its dominance in the disease complex. Since M. nivale is non-toxigenic and F. culmorum generally produces less mycotoxin than F. graminearum, mycotoxin concentrations may consequently increase.In Canada, a 3ADON chemotype of F. graminearum with increased toxigenic and ecological fitness had replaced the 15ADON chemotype indicating genetic differentiation along environmental gradients (Ward et al., 2008). Two recent reviews have considered these and other changes in FHB pathogen populations with potential concomitant changes in mycotoxin contamination (Xu {\&} Nicholson, 2009; Paterson {\&} Lima, 2010) and discussion about climate change and mycotoxins appears in Paterson {\&} Lima (2010) and Magan et al. (2011). changes in the appearance of mycotoxins because of climate change. Using linked models for FHB, wheat and climate change, Fernandes et al. (2004) projected the risk of FHB in selected areas of Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina to show that the risk index was greater under climate change scenarios than at any time during the last 30 years Under climate change grain quality may deteriorate as a direct effect of increasing temperature and CO2 that reduces protein and micronutrient content in grain, Conditions during storage can increase DON concentration several fold within a few weeks if contaminated grains are stored with high moisture levels (Birzele et al., 2000), but grains stored at a moisture activity of {\pounds}0{\AE}70 aw (approximately 10--11{\%} moisture content) will not generally spoil or produce mycotoxins. Although the severity and toxigenicity is projected to increase under climate change (combination of rainfall and temperature at anthesis) with an altered distribution of FHB (Madgwick et al., 2010), the information is not enough to make generalization such as {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}increasing climate variability will produce more frequent epidemics of FHB'' (Miller, 2008). To be effective, partial resistance has to be combined with agronomic and other practices to develop robust integrated crop protection strategies, which will not suffer such boom--bust cycles. Knowledge of pathogen biology and epidemiology in farming systems must improve significantly to account for changes in geographical distribution of crops to better manage necrotrophs under climate change Worldwide, for every 100 agricultural workers, between one and three suffer acute pesticide poisoning, leading to many thousands of fatalities; developing countries experience 99{\%} of the deaths while using 25{\%} of the world's production of pesticides (UNEP, 2004). Between 1991 and 2000, total agricultural research and development spending declined by 0{\AE}4{\%} annually in Africa, but increased by 3{\AE}3{\%} in Asia. As a result, land productivity in East Asia increased from US{\$}1485 ha)1 in 1992 to US{\$}2129 ha)1 in 2006, but declined in sub-Saharan Africa from 79{\%} of that in East Asia in 1992 to59{\%}in 2006 (IFPRI, 2008). From a food-security perspective, emphasis must now shift from impact assessment to developing adaptation and mitigation strategies and options. firstly, to evaluate under climate change the efficacy of current physical, chemical and biological control tactics including disease-resistant cultivars, and secondly, to include future climate scenarios in all research aimed at developing new tools and tactics. Transgenic solutions (Huang et al., 2002) must receive serious consideration in integrated disease management strategies to improve food security.},

  abstract = {This article reports a lack of pathogenic specialization among Australian Fusarium graminearum and F pseudograminearum causing crown rot (CR) of wheat using analysis of variance (ANOVA), principal component and biplot analysis, Kendall's coefficient of concordance (W), and K statistics. Overall, E pseudograminearum was more aggressive than F graminearum, supporting earlier delineation of the crown-infecting group as a new species. Although significant wheat line-pathogen isolate interaction in ANOVA suggested putative specialization when seedlings of 60 wheat lines were inoculated with 4 pathogen isolates or 26 wheat lines were inoculated with 10 isolates, significant W and kappa showed agreement in rank order of wheat lines, indicating a lack of specialization. The first principal component representing nondifferential aggressiveness explained a large part (up to 65{\%}) of the variation in CR severity. The differential components were small and more pronounced in seedlings than in adult plants. By maximizing variance on the first two principal components, biplots were useful for highlighting the association between isolates and wheat lines. A key finding of this work is that a range of analytical tools are needed to explore pathogenic specialization, and a statistically significant interaction in an ANOVA cannot be taken as conclusive evidence of specialization. With no highly resistant wheat cultivars. Fusarium isolates mostly differ in aggressiveness; however, specialization may appear as more resistant cultivars become widespread.},

Reduction in plant height due to anthracnose was partially compensated for by growth enhancement at elevated CO2 in Fitzroy but not in Seca. Anthracnose severity was reduced under elevated CO2 although the reduction was only significant in Fitzroy. Delayed and reduced germination, germtube growth and appressoria production were partly responsible for the reduced severity. Despite an extended incubation period, C. gloeosporioides developed sporulating lesions faster and produced more spores per day within the same latent period at high CO2 and ambient CO2. When Fitzroy seedlings grown at 700 ppm CO2 were exposed to pathogen inoculum under field conditions, they consistently developed more severe anthracnose with more lesions than seedlings grown at ambient CO2. The environmental variable, which correlated most strongly with the dispersal and infection of C. gloeosporioides spores in the field, was relative humidity in plant canopy. We have shown that an enlarged Stylosanthes canopy under elevated CO2 can trap more spores, which can lead to more severe anthracnose under favorable weather. The implications of these findings for perennial Stylosanthes pastures are discussed.},

  abstract = {Soil multitrophic interactions transfer energy from plants as the predominant primary producer to communities of organisms that occupy different positions in the food chain and are linked by multiple ecological networks, which is the soil food web. Soil food web sequesters carbon, cycles nutrients, maintains soil health to suppress pathogens, helps plants tolerate abiotic and biotic stress, and maintains ecosystem resilience and sustainability. Understanding the influence of climate change on soil multitrophic interactions is necessary to maintain these essential ecosystem services. But summarising this influence is a daunting task due to a paucity of knowledge and a lack of clarity on the ecological networks that constitute these interactions. The scant literature is fragmented along disciplinary lines, often reporting inconsistent findings that are context and scale-dependent. We argue for the differentiation of soil multitrophic interactions along functional and spatial domains to capture cross-disciplinary knowledge and mechanistically link all ecological networks to reproduce full functionalities of the soil food web. Distinct from litter mediated interactions in detritosphere or elsewhere in the soil, the proposed pathogen suppression and stress tolerance interactions operate in the rhizosphere. A review of the literature suggests that climate change will influence the relative importance, frequency and composition of functional groups, their trophic interactions and processes controlling these interactions. Specific climate change factors generally have a beneficial influence on pathogen suppression and stress tolerance, but findings on the overall soil food web are inconsistent due to a high level of uncertainty. In addition to an overall improvement in the understanding of soil multitrophic interactions using empirical and modelling approaches, we recommend linking biodiversity to function, understanding influence of combinations of climatic factors on multitrophic interactions and the evolutionary ecology of multitrophic interactions in a changing climate as areas that deserve most attention.},

  abstract  = {Powdery mildew (PM) is a common and serious disease of mungbean [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek]. A few quantitative trait loci (QTL) for PM resistance in mungbean have been reported. The objective of this study was to locate QTL for PM resistance in two resistant accessions V4718 and RUM5. Simple sequence repeat markers were analyzed in an F2 population from a cross between Kamphaeng Saen 1 (KPS1; susceptible to PM) and V4718 (resistant to PM), and in F2 and BC1F1 populations from a cross between Chai Nat 60 (CN60; susceptible to PM) and RUM5 (resistant to PM). Progenies of 134 F2:3 and F2:4 lines derived from KPS1 $\times$ V4718, and 190 F2:3 and 74 BC1F1:2 lines derived from CN60 $\times$ RUM5 and CN60 $\times$ (CN60 $\times$ RUM5), respectively, were evaluated for response to PM under field conditions. Multiple interval mapping identified a major QTL on linkage group (LG) 9 and two minor QTL on LG4 for the resistance in V4718, and detected two major QTL on LG6 and LG9 and one minor QTL on LG4 for the resistance in RUM5. Comparative linkage analysis of the QTL for PM resistance in this study and in previous reports suggests that the resistance QTL on LG9 in V4718, RUM5, ATF3640 and VC6468-11-1A are the same locus or linked. One QTL on LG4 is the same in three sources (V4718, RUM5 and VC1210A). Another QTL on LG6 is the same in two sources (RUM5 and VC6468-11-1A). In addition, one QTL in V4718 on LG4 appears to be a new resistance locus. These different resistance loci will be useful for breeding durably PM-resistant mungbean cultivars. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

  abstract = {Climate change in Australia is expected to influence crop growing conditions through direct increases in elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) and average temperature, and through increases in the variability of climate, with potential to increase the occurrence of abiotic stresses such as heat, drought, waterlogging, and salinity. Associated effects of climate change and higherCO(2) concentrations include impacts on the water-use efficiency of dryland and irrigated crop production, and potential effects on biosecurity, production, and quality of product via impacts on endemic and introduced pests and diseases, and tolerance to these challenges. Direct adaptation to these changes can occur through changes in crop, farm, and value-chain management and via economically driven, geographic shifts where different production systems operate. Within specific crops, a longer term adaptation is the breeding of new varieties that have an improved performance in 'future' growing conditions compared with existing varieties. In crops, breeding is an appropriate adaptation response where it complements management changes, or when the required management changes are too expensive or impractical. Breeding requires the assessment of genetic diversity for adaptation, and the selection and recombining of genetic resources into new varieties for production systems for projected future climate and atmospheric conditions. As in the past, an essential priority entering into a ` climate-changed' era will be breeding for resistance or tolerance to the effects of existing and new pests and diseases. Hence, research on the potential incidence and intensity of biotic stresses, and the opportunities for breeding solutions, is essential to prioritise investment, as the consequences could be catastrophic. The values of breeding activities to adapt to the five major abiotic effects of climate change (heat, drought, waterlogging, salinity, and elevated CO2) are more difficult to rank, and vary with species and production area, with impacts on both yield and quality of product. Although there is a high likelihood of future increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and temperatures across Australia, there is uncertainty about the direction and magnitude of rainfall change, particularly in the northern farming regions. Consequently, the clearest opportunities for ` in-situ' genetic gains for abiotic stresses are in developing better adaptation to higher temperatures (e. g. control of phenological stage durations, and tolerance to stress) and, for C-3 species, in exploiting the (relatively small) fertilisation effects of elevated CO2. For most cultivated plant species, it remains to be demonstrated how much genetic variation exists for these traits and what value can be delivered via commercial varieties. Biotechnology-based breeding technologies (marker-assisted breeding and genetic modification) will be essential to accelerate genetic gain, but their application requires additional investment in the understanding, genetic characterisation, and phenotyping of complex adaptive traits for climate-change conditions.},

  abstract  = {Yield prediction is a major determinant of many management decisions for crop production. Farmers and their advisors want user-friendly decision support tools for predicting yield. Simulation models can be used to accurately predict yield, but they are complex and difficult to parameterise. The goal of this study is to build a simple and parsimonious model for predicting wheat yields that can be implemented in a decision tool to be used by farmers at a paddock level. A large yield data set accumulated from trials on commonly grown varieties in Western Australia is used to build and validate a generalised additive model (GAM) for predicting wheat yield. Explanatory variables tested included weather data and derivatives, geolocation, soil type, land capability, and wheat varieties. Model selection followed a forward stepwise approach in combination with cross-validation to select the smallest set of explanatory variables. The predictive performance is also evaluated using independent data. The final model uses seasonal water availability, location and year to predict wheat yield. Because the GAM model has minimal inputs, it can be easily employed in a decision tool to predict yield throughout the growing season using rainfall data up to the prediction date and either climatological averages or seasonal forecasts of rainfall for the remainder of the growing season. It also has the potential to be used as an input to agronomic models that predict the effect on yield of various management choices for fertiliser, pest, weed and disease management.},

  abstract  = {Strobilurins have been commercially used since 1996 for the control of Erysiphe graminis on cereals in Europe. Sensitivity monitoring of airborne and field samples of the pathogen detected only sensitive populations from 1996 to 1997, but in 1998 resistant wheat isolates (resistance factors of EC50s {\textgreater} 500) were found in airborne samples from three different regions in North Germany. These isolates already occurred at up to 90{\%} frequencies suggesting that resistant individuals may have high levels of fitness, and that they could have previously escaped detection with conventional methods which measure EC50s of bulk samples or which sample limited numbers of single-colony isolates per region. An alternative method measuring frequencies of resistant colonies in bulk samples at a discriminatory dose of 3 ppm trifloxystrobin relative to that at 0 ppm, showed that resistance to stobilurins can occur at frequencies which do not affect the mean EC50s of these samples. In 1999, high levels of resistance were still concentrated in parts of Germany but became detectable in other regions of the country, and in other countries including France, Belgium, UK and Denmark. Losses in performance were detected in areas with high frequencies of resistance. In a competition experiment between resistant and sensitive isolates over three generations, resistance was stable in the absence of selection; the resistant isolate appeared equal in fitness to the sensitive isolate on untreated plant material; and was rapidly selected for on strobilurin-treated material. Selection studies on bulk isolates confirmed this finding but also indicated the existence of a range of fitness levels. There were high levels of cross-resistance between strobilurins but not with demethylation inhibitors, morpholines, anilinopyrimidines and quinoxyfen. This assessment of resistance risk suggests that use recommendations of strobilurins for wheat powdery mildew control must include elements for strict resistance management. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {Tan spot of wheat, caused by the fungus Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, is a destructive disease found in wheat-growing regions worldwide that can lead to serious yield losses. Changes in cultural practices have led to an increase in the severity and incidence of tan spot. Following infection, compatible races of the fungus elicit two distinct symptoms in differential wheat lines: tan necrosis and (extensive) chlorosis. Tan necrosis has been clearly demonstrated by several groups to result from the action of a protein toxin, Ptr ToxA. Wheat sensitivity to this toxin is conditioned by a single dominant gene. The chlorosis response may be more complex and appears to involve at least two other toxins, Ptr ToxB and Ptr ToxC, produced by different races of the fungus. Distinct genes apparently condition the reaction of wheat lines to each of these chlorosis-inducing toxins. This review concentrates on significant advances that have occurred during the past decade in the characterization of this disease interaction, ranging from the epidemiology and management of tan spot to molecular host-parasite interactions. Particular emphasis is placed on work describing fungal race differentiation, production of toxins and their importance in pathogenicity, and the genetics and physiology of host response to infection.},

  abstract = {This review describes those mechanisms by which wind directly affects crop growth rates and hence yields. Wind-induced plant movement is capable of altering growth rates and leaf morphology, although this is unlikely to be a major cause of growth differences between sheltered and unsheltered crops grown outdoors. The wind's force can tear leaves or strip them from the plant. Dense plant canopies may suffer abrasion through intermittent or constant rubbing. Soil particles lifted into suspension by the wind have the potential to abrade and damage plant tissue. The wind's force can physically knock plants over, making crops difficult to harvest. Each of these mechanisms operates at a particular time of the growing season. Recovery, and hence final yield, depends on the growth stage and soil/plant moisture status when;he damage occurred, the particular species and variety as well as the preceding and subsequent weather. The fact that damage effects are so dependent on the crop and the past weather makes modelling and any simple synthesis of direct wind effects difficult. The most common forms of damage likely in Australia's agricultural regions are from sandblasting and lodging. These damage events will be intermittent - their frequency depending on the local climate. Leaf tearing is likely in broad-leafed horticultural crops, and growth effects are also likely in any windy location. It is not possible to predict what the impact of this damage, and other direct effects, will be on final yields, Based on the results in the literature, protection from damage offered by windbreaks may have as large an effect on yields as incremental microclimate benefits.},

  abstract = {Research on impacts of climate change on plant diseases has been limited, with most work concentrating on the effects of a single atmospheric constituent or meteorological variable on the host, pathogen, or the interaction of the two under controlled conditions. Results indicate that climate change could alter stages and rates of development of the pathogen, modify host resistance, and result in changes in the physiology of host-pathogen interactions. The most likely consequences are shifts in the geographical distribution of host and pathogen and altered crop losses, caused in part by changes in the efficacy of control strategies. Recent developments in experimental and modeling techniques offer considerable promise for developing an improved capability for climate change impact assessment and mitigation. Compared with major technological, environmental, and socioeconomic changes affecting agricultural production during the next century, climate change may be less important; it will, however, add another layer of complexity and uncertainty onto a system that is already exceedingly difficult to manage on a sustainable basis. Intensified research on climate change-related issues could result in improved understanding and management of plant diseases in the face of current and future climate extremes.},

  abstract = {A possible scenario for the end of the 21\textsuperscript{st} century is that the atmospheric CO2 concentration will be in the range of 510-760 mu L L(-1) and that the mean global temperature will be 1.5-4.5 degrees C higher. Further, there may be greater incidences of extreme climatic events, which together with the CO2 and temperature changes will influence development, growth and grain yield of cereals such as rice and wheat. For these C-3, plants, the driving force for the growth response to elevated CO2 is higher leaf CO2 assimilation rates (4). However, the response of A to CO2 depends on temperature with maximum absolute increases occuring at temperatures which do not cause flower abortion, while negligible increases are observed at low temperatures. At high temperatures, where A is reduced because of partial inactivation of photosynthetic enzymes, the increase in A due to CO2 enrichment is still observed. Other factors, such as changes in shoot water relations or hormone concentrations, may influence growth at elevated CO2 concentrations. Wheat and rice development is accelerated by high temperature and consequently grain yield is reduced because there is less time for radiation to be intercepted during the vegetative phase. Although high CO2 also accelerates development in rice and, to a lesser extent in wheat, the extra carbohydrate produced by increases in A results in at least a 40{\%} increase in grain yield at temperatures which do not cause flower abortion. This is due mainly to increased tiller numbers rather than increases in the number or weight of individual grains. However, the yield enhancement due to high CO2 will not necessarily compensate for decreases in yield caused by accelerated development at high temperatures. As predicted by the response of A to high CO2, the relative increase in yield, due to rising CO2 concentrations, is smaller at lower temperatures. Elevated atmospheric CO2 may improve the tolerance of plants to heat-induced drought stress by facilitating the maintenance of cell volume and photosynthetic function in the leaves. Increased carbohydrate storage in the stems may also be an advantage during grain filling if the flag leaves senesce prematurely. However, it is unlikely that the effect of very high temperatures on newer abortion will be ameliorated by high CO2. For bread making, the quality of flour produced from grain developed at high temperatures is poorer. High CO2 may also have an effect through a reduction in the protein content of wheat grain. For rice, the amylose content of the grain, a major determinant of cooking quality is increased under elevated CO2.},

However modern agriculture is dependent on phosphorus derived from phosphate rock, which is a non-renewable resource and current global reserves may be depleted in 50--100 years. While phosphorus demand is projected to increase, the expected global peak in phosphorus production is predicted to occur around 2030. The exact timing of peak phosphorus production might be disputed, however it is widely acknowledged within the fertilizer industry that the quality of remaining phosphate rock is decreasing and production costs are increasing. Yet future access to phosphorus receives little or no international attention. This paper puts forward the case for including long-term phosphorus scarcity on the priority agenda for global food security. Opportunities for recovering phosphorus and reducing demand are also addressed together with institutional challenges.},

The mutants could be divided into 3 phenotypic classes by their growth on supplemented minimal agar medium. These classes were thought to reflect mutations at a nitrate reductase structural locus (nit1), a nitrate-assimilation pathway-specific regulatory locus (nit3) and loci (at least 5) that affect the assembly of a molybdenum-containing cofactor necessary for nitrate reductase activity (NitM). Nit mutants in each phenotypic class were recovered from each of the 7 strs of F. oxysporum tested. The majority (59-96{\%}) of nit mutants recovered were nit1 mutants. With all 7 strs, nit3 and NitM mutants were recovered at a much higher frequency from minimal agar medium amended with chlorate than from potato-dextrose agar amended with chlorate. For 6 of the 7 strs, physiological complementation occurred (as a result of heterokaryon formation) between the different nit mutant phenotypes derived from the same parental str. Complementation was also observed between some nit mutants with the same phenotype. No complementation was observed between any of the nit mutants recovered from a str. of F. o. f.sp. melonis; this str. has been designated heterokaryon self-incompatible. The phenotypes of complementary nit mutants (arbitrarily designated nitA and nitB) recovered by other workers in 3 previous studies were also determined. Neither the nitA nor the nitB mutants corresponded with a particular mutant phenotype; all 3 phenotypes were found among the nitA and nitB mutants. With the exception of the heterokaryon self-incompatible str., all nit1 and nit3 mutants from an individual str. readily complemented the NitM mutants derived from the same str. The NitM mutants form heterokaryons rapidly and reliably and should be used as one of the nit mutant testers to identify the vegetative compatibility group to which isolates of F. oxysporum belong. It is concluded that several procedures should expedite the screening of natural populations of F. oxysporum for vegetative compatibility.},

Some of the cotton seedlings diseases are caused by the seedborne pathogens especially Colletotrichum gossypii South., C. gossypii South. var. cephalosporioides Costa, Fusarium. moniliforme Sheldon, Rhizoctonia. solani Kuhn, and other less frequent seedborne fungi (Ray {\&} McLaughlin, 1942; Klich, 1986; Julliatii {\&} Ruano, 1997) During the routine analysis, using standard blotter test, of the several acid delinted seed samples received by our seed pathology laboratory, no fungal pathogen of known importance was generally detected, but majority of the samples usually yielded F. semitectum Berk. {\&} Rav. in frequencies reaching 70{\%}. Seedling emergence testes in autoclaved sand showed no correlation between the proportion of F. semitectum infected seeds and any disease symptoms (percent seedling emergence, lesions on any seedling part and negative geotropism), but isolations from such lesions, whenever they appeared, mostly yielded F.semitectum. Several species of Fusarium have been isolated from cottonseeds, most reports being about F. moniliforme. In the the United States, Fusarium spp. consisting of F. roseum Schwabe, F. moniliforme, F. oxysporum Schlecht, and F. solani (Mart.) Sacc. were found to be most widely distributed and abundant in state of Mississippi (Davis, 1977) and in the Georgia Plains (Roncadori et al., 1971). Klich (1986) found considerable amounts of F. semitectum along with other species, in the cottonseed samples collected from the southern states of Alabama, Arizona, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, although its incidence and frequency differed from location to location and in different years at the same location depending upon the rainfall and temperature during the growing season. None of these reports however, explores the role of F. semitectum on seed and seedling quality.

Fungus was isolated from all tissues exhibiting symptoms but not from symptomless tissues. Histopathological analysis revealed that the fungus was present mainly in the parenchymatic cells of the stem base and colonized the tissues via apoplastic and symplastic pathways. Host response in advance of pathogen colonization was observed. At maturity, plants were divided into sections from the inoculated area to the head. Heads were also separated into grain, rachis and chaff components. Colonization by the fungus was assessed by isolation from surface-sterilized segments and quantified by real-time PCR. Disease symptoms and the fungus were detected up to the third node, while deoxynivalenol (DON) was present in all stem segments and heads. Within the head, the DON concentration was higher in the rachis than in the chaff and grain components. These results demonstrate that F. culmorum can extensively colonize stem tissues but not reach the head by the time of plant maturity. In contrast, DON was detected in tissues beyond those colonized by the fungus, translocating to the head where, although accumulating mainly in the rachis, significant quantities accumulated in the grain. These findings indicate that there is a potential threat of contamination of grain with DON where severe crown rot is present in a crop.},

  abstract = {Crop production is inherently sensitive to variability in climate. Temperature is a major determinant of the rate of plant development and, under climate change, warmer temperatures that shorten development stages of determinate crops will most probably reduce the yield of a given variety. Earlier crop flowering and maturity have been observed and documented in recent decades, and these are often associated with warmer (spring) temperatures. However, farm management practices have also changed and the attribution of observed changes in phenology to climate change per se is difficult. Increases in atmospheric [CO2] often advance the time of flowering by a few days, but measurements in FACE (free air CO2 enrichment) field-based experiments suggest that elevated [CO2] has little or no effect on the rate of development other than small advances in development associated with a warmer canopy temperature. The rate of development (inverse of the duration from sowing to flowering) is largely determined by responses to temperature and photoperiod, and the effects of temperature and of photoperiod at optimum and suboptimum temperatures can be quantified and predicted. However, responses to temperature, and more particularly photoperiod, at supraoptimal temperature are not well understood. Analysis of a comprehensive data set of time to tassel initiation in maize (Zea mays) with a wide range of photoperiods above and below the optimum suggests that photoperiod modulates the negative effects of temperature above the optimum. A simulation analysis of the effects of prescribed increases in temperature (0-6 degrees C in + 1 degrees C steps) and temperature variability (0{\%} and + 50{\%}) on days to tassel initiation showed that tassel initiation occurs later, and variability was increased, as the temperature exceeds the optimum in models both with and without photoperiod sensitivity. However, the inclusion of photoperiod sensitivity above the optimum temperature resulted in a higher apparent optimum temperature and less variability in the time of tassel initiation. Given the importance of changes in plant development for crop yield under climate change, the effects of photoperiod and temperature on development rates above the optimum temperature clearly merit further research, and some of the knowledge gaps are identified herein.},

  abstract  = {The underlying structure of epidemiological models, and the questions that models can be used to address, do not necessarily depend on the host organism in question. This means that certain preoccupations of plant disease modellers are similar to those of modellers of diseases in human, livestock and wild animal populations. However, a number of aspects of plant epidemiology are very distinctive, and this leads to specific challenges in modelling plant diseases, which in turn sets a certain agenda for modellers. Here we outline a selection of 13 challenges, specific to plant disease epidemiology, that we feel are important targets for future work.},

  abstract = {The inheritance and fitness of phosphine resistance was investigated in an Australian strain of the rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L.), as well as its prevalence in eastern Australia. This type of knowledge may provide insights in to the development of phosphine resistance in this species with the potential for better management. This strain was 12.2{}$\times${}resistant at the LC50 level based on results for adults exposed for 20{}h. Data from the testing of F1 adults from the reciprocal crosses (R{}$\times${}S and S{}$\times${}R) showed that resistance was autosomal and inherited as an incompletely recessive trait with a degree of dominance of $-$0.88. The dose--response data for the F1{}$\times${}S and F1{}$\times${}R test crosses, and the F2 progeny were compared with predicted dose--response assuming monogenic recessive inheritance, and the results were consistent with resistance being conferred by one major gene. There was no evidence of fitness cost based on the frequency of susceptible phenotypes in hybridized populations that were reared for seven generations without exposure to phosphine. Lack of fitness cost suggests that resistant alleles will tend to persist in field populations that have undergone selection even if selection pressure is removed. Discriminating dose tests on 107 population samples collected from farms from 2006 to 2010 show that populations containing insects with the weak resistant phenotype are common in eastern Australia, although the frequency of resistant phenotypes within samples was typically low. The prevalence of resistance is a warning that this species has been subject to considerable selection pressure and that effective resistance management practices are needed to address this problem.},

  abstract = {Historical records of precipitation, streamflow and drought indices all show increased aridity since 1950 over many land areas(1,2). Analyses of model-simulated soil moisture(3,4), drought indices(1,5,6) and precipitation-minus-evaporation(7) suggest increased risk of drought in the twenty-first century. There are, however, large differences in the observed and model-simulated drying patterns(1,2,6). Reconciling these differences is necessary before the model predictions can be trusted. Previous studies(8-12) show that changes in sea surface temperatures have large influences on land precipitation and the inability of the coupled models to reproduce many observed regional precipitation changes is linked to the lack of the observed, largely natural change patterns in sea surface temperatures in coupled model simulations(13). Here I show that the models reproduce not only the influence of El Nino-Southern Oscillation on drought over land, but also the observed global mean aridity trend from 1923 to 2010. Regional differences in observed and model-simulated aridity changes result mainly from natural variations in tropical sea surface temperatures that are often not captured by the coupled models. The unforced natural variations vary among model runs owing to different initial conditions and thus are irreproducible. I conclude that the observed global aridity changes up to 2010 are consistent with model predictions, which suggest severe and widespread droughts in the next 30-90 years over many land areas resulting from either decreased precipitation and/or increased evaporation.},

  abstract = {Grain yield of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under Mediterranean conditions is frequently limited by both high temperature and drought during grain growth. In this region, most rain falls during autumn and winter and water deficit emerges in the spring, resulting in a moderate stress for rain fed wheat around anthesis, which increases in severity throughout grain filling. Hence, selection of genotypes with high grain yield is the principal aim of wheat production in this region. In order to evaluate yield and dry matter accumulation in wheat genotypes as affected by terminal drought stress, a factorial experiment based on a randomized complete block design was conducted in the Research Farm Islamic Azad University, Ardabil branch in 2009. Factors were: terminal drought stress by changing in planting date at three levels (12 October, 1 November and 21 November) with wheat (Triticu aestivum L.) genotypes at four levels ('Azar-2', `Sardari', Frankia' and 'Trakia'). The results showed that various levels of terminal drought stress affected yield, dry matter accumulation and leaf area index in wheat genotypes. Mean comparisons showed that maximum grain yield (183.18 gr/m(2)) was obtained for the first planting date or the least duration of confronting with thermal drought stress in 'Azar-2' genotype and the minimum was obtained for the third planting date with 'Trakia' genotype due to the highest duration of confronting with thermal drought stress. Investigation of variance trends of dry matter accumulation indicated that in all of treatment compounds, it increased slowly until 190-200 days after sowing and then increased rapidly until 270-280 days after sowing. From 280 days after sowing to harvest time, it decreased due to increasing aging of leaves and decreasing of leaf area index. On the other hand, wheat genotypes had different responses to dry matter accumulation in confronting with thermal drought stress. Decrease in duration of terminal drought stress also significantly increased leaf area index and its maximum of it was observed by the plots that were applied on the first planting date with 'Azar-2' genotype. In all of the treatment compounds, LAI increased slowly until 190-200 days after sowing and then decreased slowly until 240-250 days after sowing. From 240-250 days after sowing until harvest time, it decreased rapidly due to hastened leaf senescence in confronting with terminal drought stress. Thus, it can be suggested that in order to increase grain yield, dry matter accumulation and leaf area index should be applied 'Azar-2' genotype with the first planting date(12 October) should be applied in the conditions of the Ardabil Plain in Iran.},

This study investigated the relationship between number of ascospores of D. pinodes at sowing and disease intensity at crop maturity. Field pea stubble infested with ascochyta blight from one site was exposed to ambient conditions at two sites, repeated in 2 years. Three batches of stubble with varying degrees of infection were exposed at one site, repeated in 3 years. Every 2 weeks, stubble samples were retrieved, wetted and placed in a wind tunnel and up to 2500 ascospores g$-$1 h$-$1 were released. Secondary inoculum, monitored using seedling field peas as trap plants in canopies arising from three sowing dates and external to field pea canopies, was greatest in early sown crops. A model was developed to calculate the effective number of ascospores using predictions from G1 blackspot manager (Salam et al., 2011b; Australasian Plant Pathology, 40, 621--31), distance from infested stubble (Salam et al., 2011a; Australasian Plant Pathology, 40, 640--7) and winter rainfall. Maximum disease intensity was predicted based on the calculated number of effective ascospores, soilborne inoculum and spring rainfall over two seasons. Predictions were validated in the third season with data from field trials and commercial crops. A threshold amount of ascospores of D. pinodes, 294 g$-$1 stubble h$-$1, was identified, above which disease did not increase. Below this threshold there was a linear relationship between ascospore number and maximum disease intensity.},

A "first line" of defense can be triggered through recognition of conserved Pathogen or Microbe Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs or MAMPs), resulting in activation of basal (or non-host) plant defenses, referred to as PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). Disease resistance responses can also subsequently be triggered via gene-for-gene type interactions between pathogen avirulence effector genes and plant disease resistance genes (Avr-R), giving rise to effector triggered immunity (ETI). The majority of the conceptual advances in understanding these systems have been made using model systems, such as Arabidopsis, tobacco, or tomato in combination with biotrophic pathogens that colonize living plant tissues. In contrast, how these disease resistance mechanisms interact with non-biotrophic (hemibiotrophic or necrotrophic) fungal pathogens that thrive on dying host tissue during successful infection, is less clear. Several lines of recent evidence have begun to suggest that these organisms may actually exploit components of plant immunity in order to infect, successfully colonize and reproduce within host tissues. One underlying mechanism for this strategy has been proposed, which has been referred to as effector triggered susceptibility (ETS). This review aims to highlight the complexity of interactions between plant recognition and defense activation towards non-biotrophic pathogens, with particular emphasis on three important fungal diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum) leaves.

  abstract = {Fusarium species infect cereal crops worldwide and cause the important diseases Fusarium head blight and crown rot in wheat. Fusarium pathogens reduce yield and some species also produce trichothecene mycotoxins, such as deoxynivalenol (DON), during infection. These toxins play roles in pathogenesis on wheat and have serious health effects if present in grain consumed by humans or animals. In the present study, the response of wheat tissue to DON has been investigated. Infusion of wheat leaves with DON induced hydrogen peroxide production within 6 h followed by cell death within 24 h that was accompanied by DNA laddering, a hallmark of programmed cell death. In addition, real-time PCR analysis revealed that DON treatment rapidly induced transcription of a number of defence genes in a concentration-dependent manner. Co-treatment with DON and the antioxidant ascorbic acid reduced these responses, suggesting their induction may be at least partially mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), commonly known to be signalling molecules in plants. Wheat defence genes were more highly expressed in wheat stems inoculated with a DON-producing fungal strain than those inoculated with a DON-non-producing mutant, but only at a late stage of infection. Taken together, the results are consistent with a model in which DON production during infection of wheat induces ROS, which on the one hand may stimulate programmed host cell death assisting necrotrophic fungal growth, whereas, on the other hand, the ROS may contribute to the induction of antimicrobial host defences.},

The model quantifies the loss of healthy growing points of lupin in all 1-m2 subunits of a field throughout a growing season. The development of growing points is modeled as a function of temperature using a 1-day time step, and disease-induced compensatory growth is accounted for. Dispersal of spores is simulated explicitly using Monte Carlo techniques. Spread of spores occurs during rainfall events on a 1-h time step. The distance traveled by spores is partially dependent on wind speed and is generated by adding the values selected from half-Cauchy distributions. The direction of travel of the spores is influenced by wind direction. The model has been employed to produce a theoretical assessment of damage from disease in two environments at five levels of seed infection. It was calculated that in a susceptible lupin cultivar with a 0.01{\%} initial seed infection, anthracnose would cause approximately 15{\%} loss of healthy growing points in a high rainfall environment in Western Australia. In a low rainfall environment, similar damage would be unlikely even with a much higher (1{\%}) level of seed infection.},

  abstract = {Climates are changing worldwide at rates not seen previously in geological time. This affects food production itself and the growth and reproduction of plant pathogens which reduce crop yield and quality. There is a need to develop an understanding of the implications and impacts of climate change on natural biodiversity, artificial landscapes as well as production agriculture (defined here as a generalization embracing all of the primary uses of land for agriculture, horticulture and forestry), since these form parts of an integrated continuum. Currently, 20-25{\%} of harvested crops worldwide are lost to pre- and post-harvest diseases and climatic change is expected to increase these losses. Climatic change results in increasing variability and altered scales of temperature, rainfall and wind velocity and periodicity. These changes affect the activities and vigour of aerial and soilborne pathogens. Some pathogens capable of devastating crops and harvested produce have become more active and damaging because their geographical ranges expand as a consequence of climate change. Human populations are increasing rapidly, resulting in greater demands on all natural resources which far outstrip supplies. Natural biodiversity is being damaged, frequently beyond repair and not infrequently with little or no knowledge of the characteristics of the plant genotypes being lost. Only very recently have analyses of ecosystem services begun revealing the intricate and delicate webs of unappreciated natural assets which are vital for human sustainable (used here to describe processes and actions which balance resource-use with resource-availability and conserve economic, environmental and social welfare) survival. The combination of climatic change, expanding human demands for food, resources and space and the increased activities of plant pathogens presents pathologists with immense challenges. Previously, visionary plant pathologists have contributed hugely to solving humanity's problems. Current challenges compounded by climate change offer opportunities for the exploitation of our profession's capacities for working with 'one foot in the furrow (and) one hand on the bench' with increasing relevance for society at large.},

When grain was colonized with the pathogen, ground and applied with the seed at planting or spread around young plants as an aqueous suspension, high levels of crown rot were produced, but resistance (usually measured as per cent diseased plants or tillers) was still expressed. Similar results were achieved with induced field inoculum obtained by inoculating an area of wheat to obtain a high incidence of disease and incorporating the stubble into the soil. Natural field inoculum and inoculation of seed with spores produced lower levels of disease, although differentiation of resistant and susceptible cultivars was still possible. Other methods, suitable only for plants in pots and often for more specific purposes (for example, for inoculation at different stages of plant growth) were also studied. Resistance was best expressed where inoculum was applied onto or into soil, rather than directly onto or into plants. Currently, the resistance of all potential cultivars for release in Queensland is assessed in the field by sowing seed dusted with benomyl into furrows along which ground, colonized grain is distributed. Crown rot severity is then determined at maturity.},

A clock mechanism involving the genes white-collar-1 and white-collar-2 (wc-1 and wc-2) that encode a transcriptional activator (as well as a blue-light receptor) and an oscillator frequency (frq) that encodes a cyclin that deactivates the activator is used to guide this discovery process through three cycles of microarray experiments. Central to this discovery process is a new methodology for the rational design of a Maximally Informative Next Experiment (MINE), based on the genetic network ensemble. In each experimentation cycle, the MINE approach is used to select the most informative new experiment in order to mine for clock-controlled genes, the outputs of the clock. As much as 25{\%} of the N. crassa transcriptome appears to be under clock-control. Clock outputs include genes with products in DNA metabolism, ribosome biogenesis in RNA metabolism, cell cycle, protein metabolism, transport, carbon metabolism, isoprenoid (including carotenoid) biosynthesis, development, and varied signaling processes. Genes under the transcription factor complex WCC ( = WC-1/WC-2) control were resolved into four classes, circadian only (612 genes), light-responsive only (396), both circadian and light-responsive (328), and neither circadian nor light-responsive (987). In each of three cycles of microarray experiments data support that wc-1 and wc-2 are auto-regulated by WCC. Among 11,000 N. crassa genes a total of 295 genes, including a large fraction of phosphatases/kinases, appear to be under the immediate control of the FRQ oscillator as validated by 4 independent microarray experiments. Ribosomal RNA processing and assembly rather than its transcription appears to be under clock control, suggesting a new mechanism for the post-transcriptional control of clock-controlled genes.},

  abstract = {The monitoring of crop production and irrigation at a regional scale can be based on the use of ecosystem process models and remote sensing data. The former simulate the time courses of the main biophysical variables which affect crop photosynthesis and water consumption at a fine time step (hourly or daily); the latter allows to provide the spatial distribution of these variables over a region of interest at a time span from 10 days to a month. In this context, this study investigates the feasibility of using the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from remote sensing data to provide indirect estimates of: (1) the leaf area index (LAI), which is a key-variable of many crop process models; and (2) crop coefficients, which represent the ratio of actual (AET) to reference (ET0) evapotranspiration. A first analysis is performed based on a dataset collected at field in an irrigated area of the Haouz plain (region of Marrakesh, Central Morocco) during the 2002-2003 agricultural season. The seasonal courses of NDVI, LAI, AET and ETO have been compared, then crop coefficients have been calculated using a method that allows roughly to separate soil evaporation from plant transpiration. This allows to compute the crop basal coefficient (K-cb) restricted to the plant transpiration process. Finally, three relationships have been established. The relationships between LAI and NDVI as well as between LAI and Kcb were found both exponential, with associated errors of 30{\%} and 15{\%}, respectively. Because the NDVI saturates at high LAI values ({\textgreater}4), the use of remotely-sensed data results in poor accuracy of LAI estimates for well-developed canopies. However, this inaccuracy was not found critical for transpiration estimates since AET appears limited to ETO for well-developed canopies. As a consequence, the relationship between NDVI and Kcb was found linear and of good accuracy (15{\%}). Based on these relationships, maps of LAI and transpiration requirements have been derived from two Landsat7-ETM+ images acquired at the beginning and the middle of the agricultural season. These maps show the space and time variability in crop development and water requirements over a 3 km x 3 km irrigated area that surrounds the fields of study. They may give an indication on how the water should be distributed over the area of interest in order to improve the efficiency of irrigation. The availability, in the near future, of Earth Observation Systems designed to provide both high spatial resolution (10 m) and frequent revisit (day) would make it feasible to set up such approaches for the operational monitoring of crop phenology and irrigation at a regional scale.

  abstract = {The highest level of infection of coleoptiles of wheat, barley, and oat by Bipolaris sorokiniana in the field occurred near the soil surface. At a planting depth of 6-7 cm, over half of the tissue area above the seed was infected while symptoms were visible on only 0-6{\%} of the tissue. Infection of wheat and barley by this pathogen in the greenhouse reduced the leaf area of plants at the two-leaf growth stage compared to noninfected plants. This likewise occurred prior to the appearance of disease symptoms. These observations may help explain why common root rot is associated primarily with reduced tillering even though severe symptoms only appear after tiller number is established. Early infections reduce leaf growth at a time when tiller number is being determined.},

  abstract = {Knowing pests and diseases that may cause injuries and are likely to affect plant health and quality is critical to minimizing the gap between attainable yield and actual yield. In this paper, we highlight concepts and strategies aimed at controlling major biotic constraints affecting wheat in intensive production systems and present emerging challenges, with a special attention to the developing world. Disease epidemics result from the combination of inoculum, favorable environment, and host susceptibility. Changes in cropping systems as a result of adoption of conservation agriculture may have serious implications. Necrotrophic pathogens such as those responsible for tan spot or septorias are likely to emerge, and Fusarium head blight may increase. However, resistance breeding combined with rotations, timely sowing, and irrigation or even fungicide utilization, if affordable, are part of integrated crop management practices that can minimize losses. In South Asia, the effect of spot blotch, a devastating foliar disease caused by Cochliobolus sativus, can be minimized by reducing physiological stress through timely sowing and adequate use of fertilizers, which demonstrates the complex relationships among crop physiology, disease resistance, and yield. Although some root rots that induce premature death of tillers in cooler high-yielding humid environments can be important, the dryland crown rot (Fusarium spp.), common root rot (C. sativus), and the cereal nematode (Heterodera spp. and Pratylenchus spp.) should not be ignored. These are all known to be much more damaging under suboptimal moisture (rainfed or supplementary irrigation), particularly where plant growth is stressed. Climate change is likely to modify the wheat disease spectrum in some regions, and pathogens or pests considered unimportant today may turn out to be potential new threats in future.},

This study was designed to compare the aggressiveness of the FCR complex members including F. culmorum, F. pseudograminearum and F. graminearum in causing seedling blight, decreased plant vigour and crown rot. To assess their relative pathogenicity, two hard red spring wheat cultivars and two durum wheat cultivars were inoculated in the field with five isolates from each of the three species for two years. Significant differences in patterns of pathogenicity were identified. In particular, F. culmorum caused greater seedling blight while F. pseudograminearum and F. graminearum caused greater crown rot. Greatest yield reductions were caused by F. pseudograminearum. Cultivar differences were identified with respect to seedling disease and late season crown rot. No interactions were identified between cultivar performance and isolates or species with which they were challenged.},
  annote   = {Dyer, Alan T. Johnston, Robert H. Hogg, Andrew C. Johnston, Jeffrey A. The primary objectives of this study were to (1) compare virulence and aggressiveness of F. culmorum, F. pseudograminearum and F. graminearum on spring and durum wheat (Triticum turgidum var. durum) (2) determine if isolates within species vary in their patterns of pathogenicity and (3) determine whether variation in tolerance among cultivars is dependent on isolates and/or species with which they are challenged. To address these objectives, inoculated field trials were conducted during the summers of 2005 and 2006 using fifteen Fusarium isolates and two popular cultivars of hard red spring and durum wheat. while F. culmorum is capable of surviving between cycles as durable chlamydospores in the soil as well as in plant residue (Sitton and Cook 1981; Pereyra and Dill-Macky 2004). Not requiring residues for survival may allow F. culmorum to be a more aggressive seedling pathogen and preclude it from causing severe crown rot as lower plant stands generally decrease crown rot severity later in the season due to decreased water stress (Cook, 1980). Previous work has indicated that F. pseudograminearum is more active in warmer (Cook 1981) and wetter environments (Smiley and Patterson 1996). This seems partially confirmed in this study where F. pseudograminearum showed it was capable of aggressively attacking seedlings in the warmer, wetter spring of 2006 but not in 2005. it is worth noting that despite differences in seedling blight and late season disease, tiller densities did not differ significantly among isolates and were therefore probably not the source of yield differences described. Similar to the results of others (Smiley et al. 2005a), patterns of pathogenicity and aggressiveness among isolates varied according to trial year. Why this occurs is unknown. For this study, assessment of inoculum, seed quality and cultural practices has not identified significant sources of this variation. Whether uncontrolled factors like climate interact with isolate variability to create these yearly differences needs to be addressed. This study did not identify any species or isolate specific resistance as no interactions between cultivar performance and isolates were identified. Significant interactions occurred between yield and other response variables including DSI, stand, and vigour ratings. The strongest of these was the interaction between DSI and yield, where a significant correlation was detected across both years of this study. This correlation was not surprising as crown rot primarily affects plants during grain fill. In contrast to crown rot, stand and vigour ratings only correlated with yield in the second year of this trial when large stand losses were experienced. Yield losses due to reductions in stand are often minimised by the ability of neighbouring wheat plants to compensate for losses in stand. Both vigour and percent stand reflect the impacts of relatively early season infections and correlated well with each other in this study},

  abstract = {Human driven changes in the Earth's atmospheric composition are likely to alter plant disease in the future. We evaluated the effects of elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) and ozone (O-3) on three economically important soybean diseases (downy mildew, Septoria brown spot and sudden death syndrome-SDS) under natural field conditions at the soybean free air concentration enrichment (SoyFACE) facility. Disease incidence and/or severity were quantified from 2005 to 2007 using visual surveys and digital image analysis, and changes were related to microclimatic variability and to structural and chemical changes in soybean host plants. Changes in atmospheric composition altered disease expression, but responses of the three pathosystems varied considerably. Elevated CO2 alone or in combination with O-3 significantly reduced downy mildew disease severity (measured as area under the disease progress curve-AUDPC) by 39-66{\%} across the 3 years of the study. In contrast, elevated CO2 alone or in combination with O-3 significantly increased brown spot severity in all 3 years, but the increase was small in magnitude. When brown spot severity was assessed in relation to differences in canopy height induced by the atmospheric treatments, disease severity increased under combined elevated CO2 and O-3 treatment in only one of the 3 years. The atmospheric treatments had no effect on the incidence of SDS or brown spot throughout the study. Higher precipitation during the 2006 growing season was associated with increased AUDPC severity across all treatments by 2.7 and 1.4 times for downy mildew and brown spot, respectively, compared with drought conditions in 2005. In the 2 years with similar precipitation, the higher daily temperatures in the late spring of 2007 were associated with increased severity of downy mildew and brown spot. Elevated CO2 and O-3 induced changes in the soybean canopy density and leaf age likely contributed to the disease expression modifications.},

  abstract  = {Atmospheric change studies conducted in free air concentration enrichment (FACE) systems and open-topped chambers have increased understanding of how factors, such as rising CO2 and O3 levels, impact the development of plant disease epidemics. Using these systems, plant scientists have been able to study host/pathogen systems under real-world conditions where variations in multiple environmental parameters impact disease outcomes. Results from these studies are useful for evaluating earlier predictions on plant responses to climate-change parameters and the resulting impacts on plant disease epidemics. Some of these predictions have been verified, whilst others have yet to be tested. Significant interactions among climate-change parameters are highlighting the importance of conducting studies under real-world conditions. The development of molecular and gene expression tools is allowing the fine scale mechanisms responsible for the observed reactions to be determined, and should increase the ability to predict plant disease outcomes under future climatic conditions.},
  annote    = {Plant disease expression results from a three-way interaction of a susceptible host plant, a virulent pathogen and an environment suitable for disease development; referred to as the disease triangle. Changes in environmental conditions are known to exacerbate plant disease symptoms (Boyer, 1995; McElrone et al., 2001) and are implicated in 44{\%} of new disease emergence (Anderson et al., 2004b).Thus, the altered environmental conditions associated with climatic change (e.g. temperature regimes, atmospheric chemistry and drought) have the potential to alter the incidence and severity of plant disease epidemics and disease pressures on natural and crop plant systems, as well as to reshape the co-evolutionary relationships between plants and pathogens (Chakraborty, 2005; Burdon et al., 2006; Fargette et al., 2006; Ziska{\&}Runion, 2007; Crowl et al., 2008). Even changes in the host can alter the microenvironment experienced by the pathogen, as canopy density and structure can affect parameters of temperature, moisture and UV light levels at infection sites. By 2050, CO2 concentrations are expected to double the pre-industrial levels, whilst O3 concentrations are increasing by as much as 2{\AE}5{\%} annually and are expected to reach a global mean of {\textgreater}60 nmol mol)1 (Prather et al., 2001; Vingarzan, 2004; Solomon et al., 2007) The negative effects of elevated O3 on plant physiology, growth and yield are primarily linked to decreased photosynthetic capacity caused by damage to the photosynthetic biochemical machinery that result in visible lesions, decreased leaf longevity and premature leaf senescence (Sandermann, 1996; Reichenauer et al., 1998; Miller et al., 1999; Long{\&} Naidu, 2002; Morganet al., 2004). However, when elevated CO2 and O3 are considered in combination, the opposite responses offset for most of the parameters associated with biomass accumulation. Plant height, leaf area, leaf area index, total biomass, ripening and senescence show no significant responses under the combination of conditions, whilst responses of shoot and root biomass and crop yield can be negative but dampened under these conditions (Table 1). Oxidative bursts caused by acute O3 treatments also affect antagonistic and synergistic interaction between the plant growth regulators ethylene (ET), salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA). Phytohormone- activated defence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging gene transcripts increased in response to O3 because of the oxidative stress O3 induced upon entering the apoplast (Schraudner et al., 1996; Puckette et al., 2009). Elevated CO2 alters the phenylpropanoid profile as well. However, unlike elevatedO3, elevated CO2 induces production of scopolin and 4- and 5-O-caffeoyl-D-quinic acid (CGA). The increase in these compounds elevates resistance against Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and the fungus Cercospora nicotianae in tobacco (Shadle et al., 2003; Matros et al., 2006). Boyer (1995) proposed the following two mechanisms to explain how water stress increases the susceptibility of plants to attack by pathogens: (i) reduced photosynthate production induced by drought eliminates the plant's ability to produce defensive compounds; or (ii) plant growth is reduced without reducing the pathogen's ability to reproduce, thus allowing further progression and increased symptom severity in the host. Also, ABA suppresses phenylpropanoid (PAL) activity and ROS production, which are the major defence processes against pathogens (Ward et al., 1989; McDonald {\&} Cahill, 1999; Audenaert et al., 2002;

period on the severity of arable crop disease epidemics. The review focuses on two well-studied UK arable crops, wheat and oilseed rape, relating these examples to worldwide food security. In wheat, impacts of changes in concentrations of SO2 in air on two septoria diseases are discussed using data obtained from historical crop samples and unpublished experimental work. Changes in SO2 seem to alter septoria disease spectra both through direct effects on infection processes and through indirect effects on soil S status. Work on the oilseed rape diseases phoma stem canker and light leaf spot illustrates indirect impacts of increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, mediated through climate change. It is projected that, by the 2050s, if diseases are not controlled, climate change will increase yields in Scotland but halve yields in southern England. These projections are discussed in relation to strategies for adaptation to environmental change. Since many strategies take 10--15{}years to implement, it is important to take appropriate decisions soon. Furthermore, it is essential to make appropriate investment in collation of long-term data, modelling and experimental work to guide such decision-making by industry and government, as a contribution to worldwide food security.},
  annote    = {Currently, more than 1 billion people (one-sixth of world population) do not on average have enough to eat (FAO, 2009). In normal circumstances and most parts of the world, this has little to do with losses to pests and diseases and much to do with access to input resources and power within society (Sen, 1999). Some estimates for four of the largest crops put actual worldwide losses to diseases, despite use of crop protection strategies, as high as 55 kg per person per season (Table 1, assuming a world population of 6{\AE}5 billion) Regardless of the problems of financial measurement, the food security problems associated with crop diseases are especially severe in the developing world, where even local destruction of crops can lead to starvation for farming families (Strange {\&} Scott, 2005; Forbes {\&} Simon, 2007). The aim of this review is to examine how environmental change associated with both direct and indirect impacts of human-caused changes in air composition may impact on severity of crop disease epidemics. Two UK arable crops are used as examples, because they are well studied; nonetheless, general conclusions can be tentatively drawn from these local examples. However, high SO2 3 concentrations in the water in which spores were suspended for artificial inoculation favoured infection of wheat leaves by spores of P. nodorum more than they favoured infection by spores of M. graminicola. Furthermore, glasshouse experiments in which wheat grown with different nutrient solution treatments was inoculated with the pathogens suggest that, although low sulphate concentration in soil favours both pathogens, it benefits M. graminicola much more. Given that the two pathogens must compete for resources, since they both infect the same leaves under similar environmental conditions (Shaw et al., 2008), relatively moderate changes in host susceptibility mediated by changes in airborne S input to the soil could change the balance between the two pathogens Chandramohan (2010), these results do suggest a mechanism by which SO2 concentrations in the air could influence the range of diseases affecting a crop, and the historical data suggest that they have done so. Such impacts can include changes in the predominant disease present on a crop (Bearchell et al., 2005; Shaw et al., 2008), changes in the range or severity of epidemics (Evans et al., 2008) or introduction of new diseases to a region (Shaw {\&} Osborne, 2011). However, long-term data sets are needed to test the models used for projection, with both disease / pathogen data and gaseous composition / weather data (Jeger{\&}Pautasso, 2008). Projections in which values of explanatory variables (e.g. temperature, rainfall) remain within the range of those observed when collecting the experimental data must be more secure than those projections which extrapolate beyond this range; hence Evans et al. (2008) projected forward to the 2020s and 2050s, but not the 2080s, which would have taken relationships within the model outside the range of observed data. It is particularly important to assess threats to food production in areas of the world most threatened by environmental change where there are already serious shortages of food, such as sub- Saharan Africa (Strange {\&} Scott, 2005; Schmidhuber {\&} Tubiello, 2007) but, in general, data are least available and experiments hardest to do in the poorest communities. The efforts that have been made are hindered by the relatively complex epidemiology of many pathogens and great sensitivity of final disease severity to small environmental changes. Furthermore, the relationships in most weatherbased models developed for use in disease forecasting are often not adequate for projection of the disease into future climates (Bourgeois et al., 2004; Shaw, 2009) Another action assisting adaptation to the altered environment may be to sow seed of cultivars that are more resistant against the pathogens favoured by the changed environment. The effectiveness of this resistance can be expected to improve if disease epidemics gradually become more severe, since disease resistance will then have a greater weighting in the selection criteria used by individual breeders and national testing procedures, such as the UK HGCA Recommended Lists However, that is no reason not to make projections (Stern, 2007), provided that any assumptions made are clearly stated (Evans et al., 2010), since they provide the best available basis for discussion of current decision making. It is particularly important to assess threats to food production in areas of the world most threatened by environmental change where there are already serious shortages of food, such as sub- Saharan Africa (Strange {\&} Scott, 2005; Schmidhuber {\&} Tubiello, 2007)},

  abstract = {To achieve high throughput analysis of genomic DNA from small amounts of plant tissue, a standard nucleic acid extraction was formatted to microplates by linking a novel series of interlocking plates. The protocol integrates steel pellet tissue homogenization and unique liquid handling and phase separation techniques with minimal special equipment. The method was validated for difficult plant DNAs, such as hop (Humulus lupulus L.), soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.], and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.), with agarose gel separations of restriction fragments and Southern blot analysis of transgene integrants in soybean. The range of success rates for Southern blots was 73 to 92{\%} per sample per plate (n = 2016 samples). Variation in absolute yield was quantified by PicoGreen microplate flourimetry. The variation in yield among samples per plate was small enough to obviate individual sample concentration adjustment before Southern analysis. Average absolute yield for the barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) mapping population based on flourimetry was 6.8 mu g +/- 0.85 SE, n = 96; providing enough pure, stable DNA for many individual polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reactions. Intersample cross-contamination and suitability for PCR analysis were validated by simple sequence repeat (SSR) display of a previously characterized barley mapping population. Cost calculation from a materials detail was U.S. {\$}0.17 per sample extraction. Although the implementation requires some skill and practice, we rind it to be a robust, adaptable, and versatile alternative to expensive commercial kits.},

  abstract  = {Fusarium oxysporum is an economically important pathogen causing wilting or rotting disease symptoms in a large number of crops. It is proposed to have a structured, {\textquotedblleft}two-speed{\textquotedblright} genome: i.e. regions containing genes involved in pathogenicity cluster with transposons on separate accessory chromosomes. This is hypothesized to enhance evolvability. Given the continuum of adaptation of all the genes encoded in a genome, however, one would expect a more complex genome structure. By comparing the genome of reference strain Fol4287 to those of 58 other Fusarium oxysporum strains, we found that some Fol4287 accessory chromosomes are lineage-specific, while others occur in multiple lineages with very high sequence similarity - but only in strains that infect the same host as Fol4287. This indicates that horizontal chromosome transfer has been instrumental in past host-switches. Unexpectedly, we found that the sequence of the three smallest core chromosomes (Chr. 11, 12 and 13) is more divergent than that of the other core chromosomes. Moreover, these chromosomes are enriched in genes involved in metabolism and transport and genes that are differentially regulated during infection. Interestingly, these chromosomes are --like the accessory chromosomes-- marked by histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and depleted in histone H3 lysine 4 dimethylation (H3K4me2). Detailed genomic analyses revealed a complex, {\textquotedblleft}multi-speed genome{\textquotedblright} structure in Fusarium oxysporum. We found a strong association of H3K27me3 with elevated levels of sequence divergence that is independent of the presence of repetitive elements. This provides new leads into how clustering of genes evolving at similar rates could increase evolvability.},

Today, approximately a billion people are chronically malnourished while our agricultural systems are concurrently degrading land, water, biodiversity and climate on a global scale. To meet the world's future food security and sustainability needs, food production must grow substantially while, at the same time, agriculture's environmental footprint must shrink dramatically. Here we analyse solutions to this dilemma, showing that tremendous progress could be made by halting agricultural expansion, closing 'yield gaps' on underperforming lands, increasing cropping efficiency, shifting diets and reducing waste. Together, these strategies could double food production while greatly reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture.},

Climate change is related to industrialization, which has brought not only a rise in greenhouse gas emissions but also an increase in other atmospheric pollutants.

  abstract = {Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, the causal agent of fusarium wilt of banana (Musa spp.), is one of the most destructive strains of the vascular wilt fungus F. oxysporum. Genetic relatedness among and within vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense was studied by sequencing two nuclear and two mitochondrial DNA regions in a collection of 70 F. oxysporum isolates that include representatives of 20 VCGs of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense, other formae speciales, and nonpathogens. To determine the ability of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense to sexually recombine, crosses were made between isolates of opposite mating types. Phylogenetic analysis separated the F. oxysporum isolates into two clades and eight lineages. Phylogenetic relationships between F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense and other formae speciales of F. oxysporum and the relationships among VCGs and races of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense clearly showed that F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense's ability to cause disease on banana has emerged multiple times, independently, and that the ability to cause disease to a specific banana cultivar is also a polyphyletic trait. These analyses further suggest that both coevolution with the host and horizontal gene transfer may have played important roles in the evolutionary history of the pathogen. All examined isolates harbored one of the two mating-type idiomorphs, but never both, which suggests a heterothallic mating system should sexual reproduction occur. Although, no sexual structures were observed, some lineages of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense harbored MAT-1 and MAT-2 isolates, suggesting a potential that these lineages have a sexual origin that might be more recent than initially anticipated.},

  abstract = {The acquisition by parasites of the capacity to infect resistant host genotypes, that is, resistance-breaking, is predicted to be hindered by across-host fitness trade-offs. All analyses of costs of resistance-breaking in plant viruses have focused on within-host multiplication without considering other fitness components, which may limit understanding of virus evolution. We have reported that host range expansion of tobamoviruses on L-gene resistant pepper genotypes was associated with severe within-host multiplication penalties. Here, we analyze whether resistance-breaking costs might affect virus survival in the environment by comparing tobamovirus pathotypes differing in infectivity on L-gene resistance alleles. We predicted particle stability from structural models, analyzed particle stability in vitro, and quantified virus accumulation in different plant organs and virus survival in the soil. Survival in the soil differed among tobamovirus pathotypes and depended on differential stability of virus particles. Structure model analyses showed that amino acid changes in the virus coat protein (CP) responsible for resistance-breaking affected the strength of the axial interactions among CP subunits in the rod-shaped particle, thus determining its stability and survival. Pathotypes ranked differently for particle stability/survival and for within-host accumulation. Resistance-breaking costs in survival add to, or subtract from, costs in multiplication according to pathotype. Hence, differential pathotype survival should be considered along with differential multiplication to understand the evolution of the virus populations. Results also show that plant resistance, in addition to selecting for resistance-breaking and for decreased multiplication, also selects for changes in survival, a trait unrelated to the host-pathogen interaction that may condition host range expansion.},

  abstract = {The processes controlling the carbon flux and carbon storage of the atmosphere, ocean and terrestrial biosphere are temperature sensitive and are likely to provide a positive feedback leading to amplified anthropogenic warming. Owing to this feedback, at timescales ranging from interannual to the 20-100-kyr cycles of Earth's orbital variations, warming of the climate system causes a net release of CO2 into the atmosphere; this in turn amplifies warming. But the magnitude of the climate sensitivity of the global carbon cycle (termed $\gamma$), and thus of its positive feedback strength, is under debate, giving rise to large uncertainties in global warming projections. Here we quantify the median $\gamma$ as 7.7 p.p.m.v. CO2 per {$^{\circ}$}C warming, with a likely range of 1.7-21.4 p.p.m.v. CO2 per {$^{\circ}$}C. Sensitivity experiments exclude significant influence of pre-industrial land-use change on these estimates. Our results, based on the coupling of a probabilistic approach with an ensemble of proxy-based temperature reconstructions and pre-industrial CO2 data from three ice cores, provide robust constraints for $\gamma$ on the policy-relevant multi-decadal to centennial timescales. By using an ensemble of {\textgreater} 200,000 members, quantification of $\gamma$ is not only improved, but also likelihoods can be assigned, thereby providing a benchmark for future model simulations. Although uncertainties do not at present allow exclusion of $\gamma$ calculated from any of ten coupled carbon-climate models, we find that $\gamma$ is about twice as likely to fall in the lowermost than in the uppermost quartile of their range. Our results are incompatibly lower (P {\textless} 0.05) than recent pre-industrial empirical estimates of $\sim$40 p.p.m.v. CO2 per {$^{\circ}$}C (refs 6, 7), and correspondingly suggest $\sim$80{\%} less potential amplification of ongoing global warming. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The development of a molecular diagnostic capable of reliably distinguishing between the various races of the pathogen is of key importance to disease management. However, attempts to distinguish isolates using the standard molecular loci typically used for fungal phylogenetics have been complicated by a poor correlation between phylogeny and pathogenicity. Among the available alternative loci are several putative effector genes, known as SIX genes, which have been successfully used to differentiate the three races of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. In this study, an international collection of Foc isolates was screened for the presence of the putative effector SIX8. Using a PCR and sequencing approach, variation in Foc-SIX8 was identified which allowed race 4 to be differentiated from race 1 and 2 isolates, and tropical and subtropical race 4 isolates to be distinguished from one another.},

Our understanding of some fundamental aspects of DBM biology and ecology, particularly host plant relationships, tritrophic interactions, and migration, has improved con-siderably but knowledge of other aspects, e.g., its global distribution and rel-ative abundance, remains surprisingly limited. Biological control still focuses almost exclusively on a few species of hymenopteran parasitoids. Although these can be remarkably effective, insecticides continue to form the basis of management; their inappropriate use disrupts parasitoids and has resulted in field resistance to all available products. Improved ecological understand-ing and the availability of a series of highly effective selective insecticides throughout the 1990s provided the basis for sustainable and economically viable integrated pest management (IPM) approaches. However, repeated reversion to scheduled insecticide applications has resulted in resistance to these and more recently introduced compounds and the breakdown of IPM programs. Proven technologies for the sustainable management of DBM currently exist, but overcoming the barriers to their sustained adoption re-mains an enormous challenge.},

Latent period in the vector was also evaluated for both phytoplasmas under the two conditions. On average, phytoplasma multiplication was faster under cooler conditions in insects (P1, 18-22 degrees C; CO(2) 400 ppm) and under warmer conditions in plants (P2, 22-26 degrees C; CO(2) 800 ppm).

Fusarium crown and root rots are important diseases of wheat and barley world-wide. In Australia, these diseases are primarily caused by the fungal pathogen Fusarium pseudograminearum. Comparative genomic analyses showed that the F. pseudograminearum genome encodes proteins that are present in other fungal pathogens of cereals but absent in non-cereal pathogens. In some cases, these cereal pathogen specific genes were also found in bacteria associated with plants. Phylogenetic analysis of selected F. pseudograminearum genes supported the hypothesis of horizontal gene transfer into diverse cereal pathogens. Two horizontally acquired genes with no previously known role in fungal pathogenesis were studied functionally via gene knockout methods and shown to significantly affect virulence of F. pseudograminearum on the cereal hosts wheat and barley. Our results indicate using comparative genomics to identify genes specific to pathogens of related hosts reveals novel virulence genes and illustrates the importance of horizontal gene transfer in the evolution of plant infecting fungal pathogens.},

  abstract  = {The impacts of climate change on ecosystem services are complex in the sense that effective prediction requires consideration of a wide range of factors. Useful analysis of climate-change impacts on crops and native plant systems will often require consideration of the wide array of other biota that interact with plants, including plant diseases, animal herbivores, and weeds. We present a framework for analysis of complexity in climate-change effects mediated by plant disease. This framework can support evaluation of the level of model complexity likely to be required for analysing climate-change impacts mediated by disease. Our analysis incorporates consideration of the following set of questions for a particular host, pathogen, host--pathogen combination, or geographic region. 1. Are multiple biological interactions important? 2. Are there environmental thresholds for population responses? 3. Are there indirect effects of global change factors on disease development? 4. Are spatial components of epidemic processes affected by climate? 5. Are there feedback loops for management? 6. Are networks for intervention technologies slower than epidemic networks? 7. Are there effects of plant disease on multiple ecosystem services? 8. Are there feedback loops from plant disease to climate change? Evaluation of these questions will help in gauging system complexity, as illustrated for fusarium head blight and potato late blight. In practice, it may be necessary to expand models to include more components, identify those components that are the most important, and synthesize such models to include the optimal level of complexity for planning and research prioritization.},
  annote    = {This review is highly focused on Modelling systems used to predict pathogen behaviour over time and space, with the main relation Climate change. A common problem in scaling up the results of short-term empirical studies is the erroneous assumption that certain individual components of a system are equally important across all levels of integration (Rabbinge, 1989). In practice, the overall response of a system to variation in one of its components may average out over scenarios. chronic yield losses to plant diseases (i.e. yield loss not attributable to acute or emerging disease problems) are estimated at over 10{\%} of rice yield in tropical Asia (Savary et al., 2006). The average global yield loss to disease is estimated at 16{\%} (Oerke, 2006). In multispecies systems such as plant disease, climate can affect each species individually, as well as influencing the interactions between species (e.g. Legre`ve{\&}Duveiller, 2010). Our objective in this paper is to develop a framework for evaluation of complexity in the effects of climate change mediated by plant diseases. An important component of the climate-disease interaction is mesoclimate and plant-growth effects on canopy microclimate (Monteith, 1972; Huber {\&} Gillespie, 1992). Further, physiologically stressed plants often may be more susceptible to some diseases. Stressed plants may often be exposed to higher attack rates, either as a result of physical damage allowing access to pests, or as a result of physiological diversion of resources from defence to maintenance. Diseases of rainfed crops, such as phytophthora blight (PB, caused by Phytophthora drechsleri f.sp. cajani) in pigeon pea and dry root rot in chickpea, can cause almost 100{\%} crop loss as a result of weather extremes associated with climate change (Pande et al., 2010). In the Deccan Plateau of India, the frequent resurgence of PB corresponds with changing rainfall patterns in the last decade (Sharma et al., 2006; Pande{\&}Sharma, 2009). When temperatures are between 24 and 28 C and rainfall {\textgreater}300 mm within a week during the crop season, PB can completely destroy the pigeon pea crop regardless of crop cultivar. Typical disease forecasting models based on weather do not incorporate larger-scale processes or complexities that may lead to higher or lower levels of inoculum availability and pathogen dispersal (Seem, 2004). Most forecasting tools are meant for tactical decisions within a season (e.g. Butt{\&}Jeger, 1985; Rossing, 1993), or at best for strategic short-term decisions (Esker et al., 2006); a priority now is to develop methodologies for strategic long-term decisions (e.g. Teng {\&} Savary, 1992) that are congruent with the unfolding consequences of climate change and other global change factors. The translation of disease intensity into qualitative or quantitative crop losses is nonlinear and depends on a damage function (Zadoks, 1985). Addressing the consequences of epidemics on crop losses inevitably entails addressing injury mechanisms (Willocquet et al., 2004) and thus, also, host physiology (Ayres, 1981). The greater the inherent system complexity, the lower the confidence in analyses based on simple models. Even when more complex models are used, confidence in predictors will still tend to be lower for complex systems than for truly simple systems because of the propagation of error associated with each model component. A key challenge is to disentangle the direct contribution of climate change per se and its indirect effect through agricultural adaptation (Coakley et al., 1999). There are two dominant trends in adaptation: many farmers seek to reduce agricultural risks by enlarging the scale of operations and Intensifying production systems, whilst in alternative agricultural systems adaptation may be through the use of ecological buffering systems, including improved soil organic matter and water-holding capacity, minimizing potential drought effects (Lotter et al., 2003; Teasdale et al., 2007). In many countries, daily records for temperature, humidity and precipitation, etc., are available at the local scale, and there are established methodologies available for estimating hourly values from daily values [cf. Parton {\&} Logan (1981) for temperature, and Eckersten (1986) for humidity] to provide crop disease models with input. For assessments on the regional scale there are methodologies available for interpolation between locations, regularly used by weather services, for example to replace missing data. Another example of a potential increase in disease as a result of interactions of farming systems and climate change is the risk of wheat and barley fusarium head blight (FHB) as a consequence of the expansion of maize production (as may result from longer growing seasons), in particular when maize is grown in no-till systems Conversion to reduced tillage systems as part of conservation agriculture programmes (Hobbs et al., 2008; Giller et al., 2009) may increase disease risk (Bockus{\&}Shroyer, 1998). For example, in wheat-based systems (providing the food base of nearly a billion people in South Asia), the expansion of conservation agriculture is expected to increase the incidence and severity of stubble- borne diseases such as tan spot and septoria leaf blotches (Savary et al., 1997;Duveiller et al., 2007). Changes in policy may also influence the relationship between climate and disease. For example, Sweden and other European countries have previously implemented policies to reduce overproduction of wheat, such that a percentage of acreage should be under fallow not to be broken before 1 July. Fallow fields with volunteer wheat provided habitat for the leaf hopper Psammotettix alienus, which is a vector for Wheat dwarf virus (WDV) (Lindblad{\&}Waern, 2002). Whilst the effects of climate change on weather will influence plant disease, these changes in weather are and will continue to cause shifts in cropping seasons and areas as well (e.g. Valdivia et al., 2010 However, because farmers may plant crops in areas or time periods so as to avoid disease (Thurston, 1990), crop growth models may misrepresent future growing seasons or areas because normally they model the optimal conditions for the crop and do not make allowances for disease or other pests. This asynchrony can lead to model outputs for disease risk that are out of sync with the time when crops are in the field and will be experiencing disease risk. Care must be taken when projecting the effects of climate change on plant disease to ensure that the temporal parameters for both the pathogen and the crop are congruent for more accurate results Nonetheless, research into the potential effects of climate change on plant disease has often focused on development of disease in planta. This is in part because of the physical and biological complexity of inoculum dispersal processes (e.g. Aylor et al., 2001) Survival of many types of pathogen propagules is dependent on the dose of solar radiation received (e.g. Mizubuti et al., 2000;Wuet al., 2002); therefore stronger winds and shorter travel times (or cloudier conditions) increase spore survival. The effects of climate change can be exacerbated if there are feedback loops thatmake management less effective when pathogen populations increase. Feedback loops may occur when increases in disease make some types of management less efficient. Disease management that is based on reducing the amount of inoculum produced within a field is vulnerable to increased regional inoculum loads Similarly, other methods that are based at least in part on controlling within-field inoculum production, such as field sanitation and many cases of intercropping and variety mixtures, may experience reduced efficacy when regional inoculum loads are high. Because plant disease severity and incidence often increase following a compound interest model, a small increase in the length of the growing season can have a large impact on inoculumload. This in turn may influence the viability of many forms of disease management The potential for patterns of pathogen evolution to change under climate change is another important consideration (Chakraborty {\&} Datta, 2003). The effects of resistance genes can vary with temperature. For example, many rice bacterial blight resistance genes have less effect at higher temperatures, whilst one gene studied was more effective at higher temperatures (Webb et al., 2010). Durability of resistance is more complex in changing environmental conditions, although in general, the types of pathogen life history traits that confer more rapid adaptation to host resistance (McDonald {\&} Linde, 2002) may also confer more rapid adaptation to climatic conditions. Management that decreases yield losses to plant disease, in itself, can be considered a contribution to the global carbon budget, because less land must be maintained in or converted to agriculture for the same level of food production (Berry et al., 2008, 2010; Mahmuti et al., 2009). Hehehehe As potato late blight moves into new territories, it has the potential to reduce diversity in wild potato species that were previously protected by low temperatures. Wild species may experience genetic bottlenecks or even extinction as a result of rapidly changing impacts from pathogen exposure. Thirdly, higher disease levels may increase human consumption of mycotoxins and other unhealthy byproducts of plant disease. For example, elevated CO2 levels may increase fungal biomass of Fusarium pseudograminearum( Melloy et al., 2010), and thus also increase the potential for mycotoxin production Intervention technologies are available for both FHB and LB, but not readily accessible by all farmers globally. FHB models have been developed and weather based risk evaluations made available online for some regions (De Wolf et al., 2003; http://www.wheatscab.psu.edu/). Levin (2005) also discusses the role of system heterogeneity in supporting resilience, suggesting that agricultural systems are not complex adaptive systems, strictly speaking, because their simplified structures are determined exogenously rather than developing endogenously, leaving them highly vulnerable to problems such as diseases. Multiple models -- perhaps those designed to optimize precision, realism and generality -- can be used simultaneously, to improve confidence in predictions when the predictions are similar and to reveal the potential need for more information when predictions diverge. In practice, two long-term phases of model development may be necessary. In the first phase, additional research will be used to parameterize larger and more detailed models. In the second phase, the larger models will be evaluated to determine which model components are less important and can be removed from models to support policy and prioritization. Farmers who are resource-poor and economically vulnerable, with weak safety nets, are unlikely to take new risks.},

  abstract  = {The response of plant disease to weather variables such as temperature and precipitation is well known, and has been the basis for disease forecasting models used in decision-making by farmers and policy makers. Thus, plant disease risk can readily shift under climate change. Predicting changes in risk under climate change is complicated by the many biological interactions that result in disease. For example, some plant diseases occur when the phenology of plant and pathogen are aligned, in the case of Fusarium head blight so that spores are ready to infect during wheat flowering. There are numerous examples of experiments involving simulated climate change that have shown changes in disease risk. Finding indicators of climate change effects on disease in real agricultural or natural systems is more challenging because of the correlative nature of the observations and the potential for many other factors to influence disease, such as changes in host abundance. Assessments of global disease databases suggest some pathogen range shifts consistent with predicted outcomes for climate change. There are also several cases of emerging tree diseases in which climate change has likely played a role.},

Current forecasts and projections show that regions that would be affected by such population movements are low-lying islands, coastal and deltaic regions, as well as sub-Saharan Africa. Such estimates, however, are usually based on a 2{$^{\circ}$}C temperature rise. In the event of a 4{$^{\circ}$}C+ warming, not only is it likely that climate-induced population movements will be more considerable, but also their patterns could be significantly different, as people might react differently to temperature changes that would represent a threat to their very survival. This paper puts forward the hypothesis that a greater temperature change would affect not only the magnitude of the associated population movements, but also---and above all---the characteristics of these movements, and therefore the policy responses that can address them. The paper outlines the policy evolutions that climate-induced displacements in a 4{$^{\circ}$}C+ world would require.},

This integration allows readers to both verify and adapt the claims in the documents. Authors can easily reproduce the results in the future, and they can present the document's contents in a different medium, for example, with interactive controls. This article describes a software framework for both authoring and distributing these integrated, dynamic documents that contain text, code, data, and any auxiliary content needed to recreate the computations. The documents are dynamic in that the contents - including figures, tables, and so on - can be recalculated each time a view of the document is generated. Our model treats a dynamic document as a master or "source" document from which one can generate different views in the form of traditional, derived documents for different audiences. We introduce the concept of a compendium as a container for one or more dynamic documents and the different elements needed when processing them, such as code and data. The compendium serves as a means for distributing, managing, and updating the collection. The step from disseminating analyses via a compendium to reproducible research is a small one. By reproducible research, we mean research papers with accompanying software tools that allow the reader to directly reproduce the results and employ the computational methods that are presented in the research paper.

The genetic relatedness among isolates within each VCG, and between the 8 different VCGs of Foc present in Australia was determined. The DNA fingerprint patterns were VCG-specific, with each VCG representing a unique genotype. The genetic similarity among isolates within each VCG ranged from 97{\%} to 100{\%}. Among the different VCGs of Foc, 3 major clusters were distinguished which corresponded with race. All Race 1 and 2 isolates (VCGs 0124, 0125, 0128, and 01220) were closely related and clustered together, the Race 3 isolates from Heliconia clustered separately, and all Race 4 isolates (VCGs 0120, 0129, 01211, and 01213/16) clustered together. Fifteen isolates from Alstonville, NSW, were characterised because although they were classified as Race 2 based on their recovery from cooking banana cultivars, they belonged in VCG 0124, which had previously contained only Race 1 isolates. The occurrence of more than one race within a VCG means that vegetative compatibility grouping cannot be used to assign pathotype to pathogenic race as previously thought. It was possible to distinguish the Race 1 and Race 2 isolates within VCG 0124 using DNA fingerprinting, as each race produced a unique DNA fingerprint pattern. Among the Australian isolates, DNA fingerprinting analysis identified 9 different VCGs and genotypes of Foc.},

  abstract = {Changes in the incidence and onset of potato late-blight epidemics in Finland were investigated and compared with possible changes in climate, presence of soil-borne inoculum, and aggressiveness of Phytophthora infestans populations. Datasets were constructed from leaf blight assessments in cultivar trials or fungicide tests carried out at eight experimental sites during the periods 1933-1962 and 1983-2002. Additional data were obtained from late-blight monitoring projects carried out from 1991 to 2002. From 1998 to 2002, the risk of blight outbreak was 17-fold higher compared with the periods 1933-62 and 1983-1997. Simultaneously, the outbreaks of the epidemics began 2-4 weeks earlier. The changes observed were associated with a climate more conducive to blight in the late 1990s. Lack of rotation also advanced blight epidemics by an average of 9 days in 1998-2002, but it did not have this effect in 1992-1997, suggesting that soil borne inoculum may not have been a significant threat to potato until the late 1990s. The aggressiveness of the P. infestans isolates seemed to have only minor effect on the onset of the epidemics after 1991, as the apparent infection rate remained unchanged despite weather conditions more favourable to late blight in the late 1990s. As a consequence of the more frequent and earlier epidemics, the sales of fungicides used against late blight in Finland increased 4-fold from the 1980s to 2002.},

They are transmitted intracellularly during cell division, sporogenesis, and/or cell-to-cell fusion (hyphal anastomosis), and thus their life cycles generally lack an extracellular phase. Their natural host ranges are limited to individuals within the same or closely related vegetative compatibility groups, although recent advances have established expanded experimental host ranges for some mycoviruses. Most known mycoviruses have dsRNA genomes packaged in isometric particles, but an increasing number of positive- or negative-strand ssRNA and ssDNA viruses have been isolated and characterized. Although many mycoviruses do not have marked effects on their hosts, those that reduce the virulence of their phytopathogenic fungal hosts are of considerable interest for development of novel biocontrol strategies. Mycoviruses that infect endophytic fungi and those that encode killer toxins are also of special interest. Structural analyses of mycoviruses have promoted better understanding of virus assembly, function, and evolution.},

Even so, there are few studies on the impact of climate change on diseases of these crops. Findings from previous studies concerning some climate-change effects on diseases of coffee, sugarcane, eucalyptus, cassava, citrus, banana, pineapple, cashew, coconut and papaya have been summarized to provide a context. By reviewing available methods to evaluate the impact of climate change on diseases of tropical and plantation crops, we present trends for some diseases and their management strategies, identify critical gaps in knowledge, and suggest experimental and analytical approaches to advance knowledge. As the projected climate conditions will probably vary greatly in the future from continent to continent and from developed to developing countries, studies must be conducted under tropical regions considering their specific environmental conditions. Multifactor studies under realistic field situations, such as free air CO2 enrichment with increasing CO2 and O3 concentrations incorporating spectral reflectance measures in situ for realistic assessment of plant growth, are a way forward. Effects of a changing climate on chemical and biological controls are discussed in the context of changing global outlook on environmental demands for the future.},

Firstly, the approaches used for studying the potential effects of altered temperature, water availability, CO2 and O-3 air concentrations, and UV-B radiation on components of the disease cycle are explained and discussed. Next, the impact of changes in climate patterns on the geographic and temporal distribution of diseases by integrating biological and epidemiological models into geographic and climate databases are assessed. Finally, adaptation strategies are discussed and areas where there is a recognized lack of knowledge are highlighted. The literature shows that different pathosystems respond in different ways to climate change. Thus, case-by-case studies on the responses of crop species or varieties and their diseases to climate change are necessary. In addition to that, wide-scale projections of disease risk are necessary in order to identify research priorities, whereas industry must be strategically directed and public policies developed to establish adaptation measures and to prevent potential food security crisis. Only by conducting long-term and multidisciplinary studies can we reduce the uncertainty regarding the effects of climate change on plant diseases.},

Assessment of the impacts of climate change on pest infestations and disease epidemics in crops is needed as a basis for revising management practices to minimize crop losses as climatic conditions shift. Future scenarios focused on the decades of the 2020' s, 2050' s, and 2080' s ( scenarios A2 and B2) were obtained from five General Circulation Models available on Data Distribution Centre from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Geographic distribution maps were prepared using models to predict the number of generations of the nematodes and leaf miner. Maps obtained in scenario A2 allowed prediction of an increased infestation of the nematode and of the pest, due to greater number of generations per month, than occurred under the climatological normal from 1961 - 1990. The number of generations also increased in the B2 scenario, but was lower than in the A2 scenario for both organisms.},

  abstract = {Horizontal transfer (HT), or the passage of genetic material between non-mating species, is increasingly recognized as an important force in the evolution of eukaryotic genomes(1,2). Transposons, with their inherent ability to mobilize and amplify within genomes, may be especially prone to HT3-7. However, the means by which transposons can spread across widely diverged species remain elusive. Here we present evidence that host-parasite interactions have promoted the HT of four transposon families between invertebrates and vertebrates. We found that Rhodnius prolixus, a triatomine bug feeding on the blood of various tetrapods and vector of Chagas' disease in humans, carries in its genome four distinct transposon families that also invaded the genomes of a diverse, but overlapping, set of tetrapods. The bug transposons are similar to 98{\%} identical and cluster phylogenetically with those of the opossum and squirrel monkey, two of its preferred mammalian hosts in South America. We also identified one of these transposon families in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, a cosmopolitan vector of trematodes infecting diverse vertebrates, whose ancestral sequence is nearly identical and clusters with those found in Old World mammals. Together these data provide evidence for a previously hypothesized role of host-parasite interactions in facilitating HT among animals(3,7). Furthermore, the large amount of DNA generated by the amplification of the horizontally transferred transposons supports the idea that the exchange of genetic material between hosts and parasites influences their genomic evolution.},

  abstract = {This article reviews the recent progress of research on fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat. It addresses the broad areas of strategies for disease management, biological control, the pathogen (Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae)), mycotoxins, the effects of dwarfing genes on FHB severity, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and new perspectives. Where there are recent reviews on this subject, we have deliberately examined the subsequent literature to provide an update on research. With few resistant cultivars available even now, the main tools to manage the disease remain rotation, varietal selection, disease forecasting and fungicides. A few biocontrol organisms are being considered for commercial application. The pathogen's sexual life cycle has been investigated in depth, and with its complete genome sequence known, the pathways and genes controlling the sexual development and ascospore release of F. graminearum are being explored. The 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol chemotype of F. graminearum has increased in prevalence in Canada with attendant risks of higher DON levels in cereal grain. Stringent limits on allowable levels of Fusarium mycotoxins in the food/feed chain have been enacted in Europe and the USA, but regulations for Canada are only at the discussion stage with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Efforts to develop FHB-resistant lines proceed apace, as these can be selected in most wheat populations despite the adverse effects of dwarfing genes on FHB severity. While more quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for disease resistance continue to be identified and mapped, new resistant cultivars remain disappointingly few. We present some encouraging early results from an alternative approach based on epigenetics.},

This article is an introduction to a collection of reviews whose authors were asked to explore the major drivers affecting the food system between now and 2050. A first set of papers explores the main factors affecting the demand for food (population growth, changes in consumption patterns, the effects on the food system of urbanization and the importance of understanding income distributions) with a second examining trends in future food supply (crops, livestock, fisheries and aquaculture, and {\textquoteleft}wild food'). A third set explores exogenous factors affecting the food system (climate change, competition for water, energy and land, and how agriculture depends on and provides ecosystem services), while the final set explores cross-cutting themes (food system economics, food wastage and links with health). Two of the clearest conclusions that emerge from the collected papers are that major advances in sustainable food production and availability can be achieved with the concerted application of current technologies (given sufficient political will), and the importance of investing in research sooner rather than later to enable the food system to cope with both known and unknown challenges in the coming decades.},

  abstract = {The manipulation of photoperiod sensitivity during stem elongation (terminal spikelet initiation--anthesis) has been suggested as a means to increase wheat yield potential. Nevertheless, photoperiod sensitivity and the interaction with vernalization during that phase have not been previously explored under field conditions. Thus, a field study was carried out (i) to assess whether duration of stem elongation is sensitive to photoperiod experienced only during that phase, and if so (ii) to evaluate whether vernalization interacts with this photoperiod response and (iii) to determine if altering duration of stem elongation may influence wheat yield and its components. The experiment was a factorial combination of two vernalization treatments (15 (V15) or 50 (V50) days at 4$\pm$1{}{$^{\circ}$}C and 8{}h photoperiod), two photoperiod regimes during stem elongation (natural daylength in the field (NP+0) and one daylength extension of 6{}h (NP+6)) and three cultivars (Buck Manantial (BM), Eureka Ferrocarril Sur (EFS), and ProINTA Puntal (PP)). The stem elongation phase responded to the actual photoperiod experienced during that phase in the three cultivars, increasing its duration with shorter photoperiod. In the vernalization-sensitive cultivars EFS and PP, plants vernalized 50 days showed greater response to photoperiod than those vernalized 15 days. In the most photoperiod-sensitive cultivar (BM), as duration of stem elongation lengthened by exposure to less inductive photoperiod, a higher number of fertile florets at anthesis was achieved leading to an increased grain number and thereby to a higher wheat yield. These results reinforce the idea that a longer duration of stem elongation may offer an alternative avenue to improve yield potential in wheat.},

  abstract = {Seedling stand, disease severity and fungal incidence were determined from untreated 'Wakefield' soft red winter wheat planted on a Leeper silty clay loam in field tests conducted at the Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station, Plant Science Research Center, Mississippi State University, Starkville, Mississippi during the 1996201397 and 1997201398 growing seasons. Seedling stand was reduced by 40{\%} each year in plots established with untreated seed. Cochliobolus sativus was the most frequently isolated fungus. Fusarium acuminatum, Fusarium equiseti and Fusarium solani were the most prevalent Fusarium spp. Seven other Fusarium spp. and 23 species of other fungal genera were isolated. Pathogenicity tests with three isolates each of C. sativus, Cochliobolus spicifer, F. acuminatum, F. solani, F. equiseti, Fusarium compactum, Embellisia chlamydospora and Microdochium bolleyi were performed in test tube culture and two isolates each of C. sativus, C. spicifer, F. acuminatum, E. chlamydospora and M. bolleyi under greenhouse conditions. In test tubes and in the greenhouse, seedlings infected with isolates of C. sativus developed seedling blight, discoloration and necrosis, primarily in seminal roots and crowns. In the greenhouse, C. sativus induced lesions on the lower leaf sheath and reduced seedling height, seedling emergence, dry and fresh weight of roots and shoots. Isolates of F. acuminatum, F. solani, F. equiseti, F. compactum, E. chlamydospora and M. bolleyi induced slight to moderate orange to light-brown discoloration of crown and seminal roots in test tubes. Cochliobolus spicifer isolates had the most pre-emergence activity, inducing black root discoloration and root pruning of wheat seedlings and reducing seedling emergence, root fresh weight and shoot dry weight. In the greenhouse, F. acuminatum reduced seedling height, seedling emergence and root and shoot dry weights. Microdochium bolleyi and E. chlamydospora reduced fresh and dry weight of roots, plant emergence and shoot dry weight. Fusarium acuminatum and C. spicifer reduced the growth rate of wheat seedlings. All fungi evaluated showed increased disease severity compared to the untreated control. The high frequency of isolation of C. sativus from crown and root tissues can be partially explained by the dry, warm conditions during the early stages of wheat seedling development in the Upper Coastal Plain Land Resource Area of Mississippi. Die Auflaufrate von S{\"{a}}mlingen, die St{\"{a}}rke des Krank-heitsbefalls sowie die H{\"{a}}ufigkeit von Pilzarten wurden bei nicht behandelten roten Weichwinterweizen der Sorte Wakefield ermittelt, welche in einem Leeper schlammigen Tonboden an der Mississippi Agricultural {\&} Forestry Experiment Station, Plant Science Research Center, Mississippi State University, Starkville, Mississippi in der 1996201397 und 1997201398 Saison ges{\"{a}}t worden waren. In beiden Jahren wurde die Auflaufrate von nicht behandeltem Saatgut um 40{\%} reduziert. Cochliobolus sativus wurde am h{\"{a}}ufigsten isoliert. Fusarium acuminatum, Fusarium equiseti und Fusarium solani waren die {\"{u}}berwiegenden Fusarium spp. Au{\ss}ierdem wurden sieben weitere Fusarium spp. sowie 23 weitere Pilzarten isoliert. Pathogenit{\"{a}}tstests mit je 3 Isolaten von C. sativus, Cochliobolus spicifer, F. acuminatum, F. solani, F. equiseti, Fusarium compactum, Embellisia chlamydospora und Microdochiumbolleyi wurden in Reagenzr{\"{o}}hrchen durchgef{\"{u}}hrt, sowie mit je 2 Isolaten von C. sativus, C. spicifer, F. acuminatum, E. chlamydospora und M. bolleyi unter Gew{\"{a}}chshausbedingungen. Sowohl in den Reagenzr{\"{o}}hrchen als auch im Gew{\"{a}}chshaus entwickelten S{\"{a}}mlinge, die mit C. sativus inokuliert worden waren, eine F{\"{a}}ule, Verf{\"{a}}rbung sowie Nekrosis, haupts{\"{a}}chlich in den sekund{\"{a}}ren Wurzeln und in den Halmbasen. Unter Gew{\"{a}}chshausbedingungen verursachte C. sativus au{\ss}ierdem L{\"{a}}sionen der unteren Blattscheide sowie eine Reduzierung des S{\"{a}}mlingswachstums, des S{\"{a}}mlingsauflaufs, des Trocken-und Frischgewichts der Wurzeln und Sprossen. Im Reagenzr{\"{o}}hrchentest induzierten Isolate von F. acuminatum F. solani, F. equiseti, F. compactum, E. chlamydospora und M. bolleyieine schwache bis m{\"{a}}{\ss}iige orange bis hell braune Verf{\"{a}}rbung des Halmbasis und der Sekund{\"{a}}rwurzeln. Isolate von C. spicifer besa{\ss}ien die h{\"{o}}chste Vorauflaufaktivit{\"{a}}t und induzierten eine Verschw{\"{a}}rzung und Verk{\"{u}}rzung der Wurzeln sowie eine Reduzierung des S{\"{a}}mlingsauflaufs, des Wurzelfrischgewichts sowie des Sproitrockengewichts. Unter Gew{\"{a}}chshausbedingungen reduzierte F. acuminatum die S{\"{a}}mlingsh{\"{o}}he, die Auflaufrate sowie das Trockengewicht der Wurzeln und Sproien. Microdochium bolleyi und E. chlamydospora reduzierten das Frisch-und Trockengewicht der Wurzeln, die Auflaufrate sowie das Spro{\ss}itrockengewicht. Die Wachstumsrate der S{\"{a}}mlinge wurde durch F. acuminatum und C. spicifer reduziert. Alle untersuchten Pilzarten erh{\"{o}}hten die Befallsst{\"{a}}rke verglichen mit der unbehandelten Kontrolle. Die hohe Isolierungsrate von C. sativus aus dem Halmbasis-und Wurzelgewebe kann zum Teil dadurch erkl{\"{a}}rt werden, dass w{\"{a}}hrend der Fr{\"{u}}hentwicklungsphase der S{\"{a}}mlinge trockene und warme Wachstumsbedingungen in diesem Gebiet herrschten.},

  abstract = {Samples of seeds collected from commercial-ly available cotton seed lots in Turkey were assayed for Verticillium dahliae. V. dahliae was successfully isolat-ed from 67 of 104 seed lots tested, a successful isolation rate of nearly 65 {\%}. Vegetative compatibility of the isolates was assessed through complementation tests using nitrate non-utilizing mutants. Of the 188 isolates obtained, 105 were classified as VCG1A, 17 as VCG2A, 64 as VCG2B and two as VCG4B. All 50 of the isolates tested in the greenhouse on cotton cv. DP 15--21 and Acala SJ-1 were pathogenic on both culti-vars. As a group, AUDPC values were significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.05) for VCG1A than for VCG2 and VCG4B isolates. These data suggest that: (1) commer-cial cotton seed lots are commonly infected with V. dahliae and thus may serve as primary sources of the pathogen; (2) cotton isolates of V. dahliae belong to VCG1A, 2A, 2B and 4B and these strains are widely distributed via seed lots; and (3) VCG1 and VCG2 are distinct pathotypes of V. dahliae that vary in their viru-lence to cotton.},

Morphology of the fungi differed considerably between the media, with respect to presence and shape of microsclerotia, dark hyphae (i.e. short melanised hyphae attached to the microsclerotia) and dark mycelium (i.e. melanised mycelium throughout the colony). On modified soil extract agar (MSEA), a pectate based agar, V. dahliae always had globose to elongate microsclerotia, without dark hyphae or dark mycelium, whereas V. tricorpus always had dark hyphae or dark mycelium, and microsclerotia, whenever present, were globose to irregular in shape. On ethanol agar (EA), V. dahliae had large microsclerotia and abundant dark hyphae, whereas V. tricorpus did not form microsclerotia, but always abundant dark mycelium. For the first time we observed the formation of dark hyphae by V. dahliae to a great extent. In the presence of soil, most characteristics were less pronounced, and V. dahliae microsclerotia were smaller, but V. tricorpus produced large microsclerotia, even when they were absent in pure culture. Morphological characteristics suitable for discrimination between the two species on MSEA plates in the presence of soil were selected and tested with fresh isolates from agricultural fields. The two fungi could be distinguished using qualitative characteristics and microsclerotial size. Molecular analysis and morphology on potato dextrose agar confirmed all identifications made on soil dilution plates.},

  abstract = {Climate warming may raise wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields in cooler climates and lower them in warmer climates. To understand these contrasting effects, infrared heating lamps were used to warm irrigated spring wheat by 1.5 degrees C (day) and 3.0 degrees C (night) above unheated controls during different times of the year at Maricopa, AZ. Changes in wheat growth with warming were used to test hypotheses for temperature effects on crop growth in the process model ecosys. Infrared heating substantially raised phytomass growth and grain yield under lower air temperature (T(a)) following plantings from September through December. The same heating, however, lowered growth and yield under higher T(a) following plantings from January through March. Gains in wheat yield of as much as 200 g C m(-2) with heating under lower T(a) were attributed in the model to more rapid CO(2) fixation and to reduced chilling effects on seed set. These gains were only partially off set by losses from shortened wheat growth periods. Losses in wheat yield of as much as 100 g C m(-2) with heating under higher T(a) were attributed in the model to adverse effects of heating on crop water status and on CO(2) fixation vs. respiration, to greater heat stress effects on seed set, and to shortened crop growth periods. Model hypotheses thus explained contrasting effects of heating on wheat yields under different T(a) found in the field experiment as well as in many earlier studies. Well-constrained tests of these hypotheses are vital for models used to project climate change impacts on agricultural ecosystems.},

This paper reviews the direct effects of climate on both crop growth and yield and on plant pests and pathogens and the interactions that may occur between crops, pests, and pathogens under changed climate. Finally, we consider the contribution that better understanding of the roles of pests and pathogens in crop production systems might make to enhanced food security. Evidence for the measured climate change on crops and their associated pests and pathogens is starting to be documented. Globally atmospheric [CO2] has increased, and in northern latitudes mean temperature at many locations has increased by about 1.0-1.4C with accompanying changes in pest and pathogen incidence and to farming practices. Many pests and pathogens exhibit considerable capacity for generating, recombining, and selecting fit combinations of variants in key pathogenicity, fitness, and aggressiveness traits that there is little doubt that any new opportunities resulting from climate change will be exploited by them. However, the interactions between crops and pests and pathogens are complex and poorly understood in the context of climate change. More mechanistic inclusion of pests and pathogen effects in crop models would lead to more realistic predictions of crop production on a regional scale and thereby assist in the development of more robust regional food security policies.},

  abstract = {Maincrop potato yields in Scotland have increased by 3035 similar to t similar to ha-1 since 1960 as a result of many changes, but has changing climate contributed anything to this? The purpose of this work was to answer this question. Daily weather data for the period 19602006 were analysed for five locations covering the zones of potato growing on the east coast of Scotland (between 55.213 and 57.646 similar to N) to determine trends in temperature, rainfall and solar radiation. A physiologically based potato yield model was validated using data obtained from a long-term field trial in eastern Scotland and then employed to simulate crop development and potential yield at each of the five sites. Over the 47 similar to years, there were significant increases in annual air and 30 similar to cm soil temperatures (0.27 and 0.30 similar to K similar to decade-1, respectively), but no significant changes in annual precipitation or in the timing of the last frost in spring and the first frost of autumn. There was no evidence of any north to south gradient of warming. Simulated emergence and canopy closure became earlier at all five sites over the period with the advance being greater in the north (3.7 and 3.6 similar to days similar to decade-1, respectively) than the south (0.5 and 0.8 similar to days similar to decade-1, respectively). Potential yield increased with time, generally reflecting the increased duration of the green canopy, at average rates of 2.8 similar to t similar to ha-1 decade-1 for chitted seed (sprouted prior to planting) and 2.5 similar to t similar to ha-1 decade-1 for unchitted seed. The measured warming could contribute potential yield increases of up to 13.2 similar to t similar to ha-1 for chitted potato (range 7.119.3 similar to t similar to ha-1) and 11.5 similar to t similar to ha-1 for unchitted potato (range 7.115.5 similar to t similar to ha-1) equivalent to 3439{\%} of the increased potential yield over the period or 2326{\%} of the increase in actual measured yields.},

  abstract = {The diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (L.), remains a major pest of brassica crops worldwide. DBM has been estimated globally to cost US{\$} 1 billion in direct losses and control costs. Chemical control of this pest remains difficult due to the rapid development of resistance to insecticides and to their effect on natural enemies. These problems are especially severe in South Asia and Africa where lack of knowledge, limited access to newer and safer insecticides, and a favourable climate result in DBM remaining a serious year-round pest which substantially increases the cost and uncertainty of crop production. Despite these problems, application of synthetic insecticides remains overwhelmingly the most common control strategy. Biologically-based efforts to control DBM in Africa and Asia have focused strongly on parasitoid introductions. However, despite the identification and deployment of promising parasitoids in many regions, these efforts have had limited impact, often because farmers continue early-season spraying of broad-spectrum insecticides that are lethal to parasitoids and thus exacerbate DBM outbreaks. A significant driver for this pattern of insecticide use is the presence of aphids and other pests whose appearance initiates inappropriate spraying. Despite often extensive training of producers in farmer field schools, many growers seem loath to discard calendar or prophylactic spraying of insecticides. The introduction of an IPM technology that could replace the use of broad-spectrum insecticides for DBM and other key Lepidoptera is crucial if the benefits of parasitoid introduction are to be fully realised. The deployment of DBM-resistant brassicas expressing proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis could help to break this cycle of insecticide misuse and crop loss, but their deployment should be part of an integrated pest management (IPM) package, which recognises the constraints of farmers while addressing the requirement to control other Lepidoptera, aphids and other secondary pests. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Presymptomatic and accurate diagnosis of Mycosphaerella graminicola leaf blotch is desirable for the disease prediction and the timely application of fungicides. To develop a sensitive PCR assay, four specific primer pairs were designed. They were more specific than three known specific primer pairs. Three of them could detect as little as 0.5 pg M. graminicola DNA in a conventional PCR. A real-time PCR assay was applied for monitoring the disease progression in both inoculated and naturally infected wheat plants using the primer pair ST-rRNA F/R. In inoculated plants, M. graminicola DNA could be detected immediately after inoculation and a steady increase was detected before visible symptoms appeared at 8 days. The rapid growth period took place between 6 and 16 days postinoculation. In the field, the disease progression in the top three leaf layers was followed during the epidemic period. The results were significantly correlated to the disease indices (R=0.8986) and also to the number of pycnidia per leaf (R=0.9227). These suggest that the real-time PCR assay is a reliable approach for the presymptomatic and accurate detection of M. graminicola development in the field.},

The use of DNA barcodes, short DNA sequences from a standardized region of the genome, has recently been proposed as a tool to facilitate species identification and discovery. However, the effectiveness of DNA barcoding for identifying specimens in species-rich tropical biotas is unknown. Here we show that cytochrome c oxidase I DNA barcodes effectively discriminate among species in three Lepidoptera families from Area de Conservaci{\'{o}}n Guanacaste in northwestern Costa Rica. We found that 97.9{\%} of the 521 species recognized by prior taxonomic work possess distinctive cytochrome c oxidase I barcodes and that the few instances of interspecific sequence overlap involve very similar species. We also found two or more barcode clusters within each of 13 supposedly single species. Covariation between these clusters and morphological and/or ecological traits indicates overlooked species complexes. If these results are general, DNA barcoding will significantly aid species identification and discovery in tropical settings.},

  abstract = {Wheat root and crown rot (Triticum aestivum L.) is a disease problem in many wheat producing area as well as Moghan wheat growing area, Northwest of Iran. In this study, injured plants of wheat with blighting, stunting, and death of mature plants, also necrotic lesions on seminal crown roots, sub crown internodes and crown, as well as basal stem tissue symptoms were collected from different regions of Moghan wheat growing area. Fungi associated with wheat root and crown rot were isolated and identified based on general colony morphology, the morphology of mycelia, reproductive structure and taxonomic description. Also pathogenicity of 28 selected isolates from various identified species was determined on wheat (T. aestivum L. CV. Atila 4; a common grown cultivar of wheat in Moghan area) seedlings. The results indicated that the predominant pathogens implicated in causing common root and crown rot in this study was Bipolaris sorokiniana. In addition to B. sorokiniana, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium Pseudograminearum and Gaeumannomyces/Phiallophora complex are the most widely distributed species on wheat growing belt in Moghan area. Fusarium solani, Fusarium crookwellence, Fusarium clamidosporum, Fusarium proliferatum, Fusarium poa, Fusarium udum and Fusarium babinda are wheat root associated species of Fusarium ascertained during our investigation. Pathogenicity test revealed that B. sorokiniana, F. culmorum, F. graminearum, F. crookwellence, F. udum and Gaeumannomyces/Phiallophora complex are active pathogens and others are saprophytes, which are also involved in the destruction of root tissues, without being the cause of injury.},

  abstract = {Verticillium wilt systemically infects cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L .) and drastically limits crop productivity . Efforts to elucidate the physiological mechanisms responsible for growth and yield reductions have been inconclusive . Field experiments were conducted in 1987 and 1989 to document the influence of verticillium wilt on the photosynthetic and respiratory activity of cotton leaves . A portable gas-exchange measurement system was used to determine changes in net photosynthesis, photorespiration and dark respiration of lower-, middle-and upper canopy leaves of control and diseased plants . In addition, changes in stomatal behavior and chlorophyll content were also determined . Photosynthesis of diseased lower-canopy leaves was reduced by over 6 .5 {$^{\circ}$} " compared to controls, and the reduction was associated with chlorophyll loss, a more negative leaf water potential, and a greatly reduced stomatal conductance . Upper-canopy leaves of diseased plants, although showing no visible symptoms of verticillium wilt, exhibited a 20{$^{\circ}$}, decrease in photosynthetic activity which was independent of changes in chlorophyll or leaf water potential . Verticillium wilt reduced dark respiration of asymptomatic, upper-canopy leaves by4{\_} photorespiration by 27 {$^{\circ}$},-;, and increased mesophyll resistance by 46 {$^{\circ}$}o . Our results suggest that the pathogen reduced photosynthesis initially through nonstomatal processes, which were not directly mediated by water-deficit stress . In contrast, leaves with symptoms exhibited decreased photosynthesis due to combined chlorosis, water stress, and stomatal closure . Disease progression and the resultant decrease in photosynthetic capacity apparently is the product of two distinct mechanisms of pathogenicity .},

  abstract = {Changes in temperature, CO2, and precipitation under the scenarios of climate change for the next 30 yr present a challenge to crop production. This review focuses on the impact of temperature, CO2, and ozone on agronomic crops and the implications for crop production. Understanding these implications for agricultural crops is critical for developing cropping systems resilient to stresses induced by climate change. There is variation among crops in their response to CO2, temperature, and precipitation changes and, with the regional differences in predicted climate, a situation is created in which the responses will be further complicated. For example, the temperature effects on soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] could potentially cause yield reductions of 2.4{\%} in the South but an increase of 1.7{\%} in the Midwest. The frequency of years when temperatures exceed thresholds for damage during critical growth stages is likely to increase for some crops and regions. The increase in CO2 contributes significantly to enhanced plant growth and improved water use efficiency (WUE); however, there may be a downscaling of these positive impacts due to higher temperatures plants will experience during their growth cycle. A challenge is to understand the interactions of the changing climatic parameters because of the interactions among temperature, CO2, and precipitation on plant growth and development and also on the biotic stresses of weeds, insects, and diseases. Agronomists will have to consider the variations in temperature and precipitation as part of the production system if they are to ensure the food security required by an ever increasing population.},

The interaction of these parameters is complex; however, are further exaggerated by rainfall patterns during the growing season. Water is a dominant factor that will override the positive impacts of CO2 increases and further diminish plant growth and yield when coupled with temperature stresses.

Percentage infected grains and frequency of different Fusarium species was analysed in every grain sample. The effect of fungicides, glyphosate and postemergence herbicides on Fusarium grain infection was studied. Significant increase in Fusarium infection was detected in fungicide-treated plots compared with untreated plots. Fusarium avenaceum and F. tricinctum were the most frequent species detected. The internal ranking of Fusarium species remained the same after spraying. No significant effects were found on the level of Fusarium infection after glyphosate treatment in autumn or herbicide treatment during the growing season.},

We examined how co-inoculation of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk) and the baculovirus Panolis flammea nucleopolyhedrovirus (PaflNPV) in an experimental field population of Lepidopteran Mamestra brassicae larvae impacted on viral transmission dynamics. We determined how the presence of Btk influenced primary and secondary PaflNPV transmission. When Btk was co-inoculated with PaflNPV, there was increased proportional viral mortality in primary transmission studies compared to plots with virus alone. A delay of up to 4. days between applications of Btk and PaflNPV did not impact on primary viral mortality, indicating that a lag between inoculations was unlikely to affect the biocontrol potential of the two pathogens. Viral yields from cadavers in plots with Btk present were significantly lower than those from plots with virus only, and secondary cycling to introduced secondary transmission larvae was significantly reduced. Baculovirus transmission (in terms of the proportion of uninfected larvae in different treatments) was described by a 'refuge' model that allowed for heterogeneity in susceptibility and pathogen exposure. We discuss how transmission may be potentially affected by factors such as host feeding rate, spatial distribution of virus and interactions between pathogens within the insect host. This study improves understanding of the impact of pathogens within host populations and how mixtures of pathogens may be exploited for biocontrol of insect pests.},

The lower percentage of conidia producing hyphae in 700 ppm CO2 was due to a higher proportion of the spores being arrested at the appressorial stage. The reduction in penetration of spores in 700 ppm CO2 was due neither to 700 ppm CO2 per se, nor to ontogenetic changes in the host tissue. Removing the epicuticular waxes from the surface of the leaf had no effect on the development of conidia on the surface of leaves in 350 or 700 ppm CO2, showing that increased epicuticular waxes were not causing the increased resistance to primary penetration of powdery mildew in 700 ppm CO2. We relate reduced rates of primary penetration in barley grown in 700 ppm CO2 to higher rates of net photosynthesis allowing increased mobilisation of resources into resistance including the production of papillae and accumulation of silicon at the sites of appressorial penetration. Established colonies of powdery mildew grew faster in 700 ppm CO2 than in 350 ppm CO2, coincident with accumulation of host carbohydrate in the source leaf.},

  abstract = {Fusarium crown rot (FCR) of wheat is a persistent problem that causes significant losses worldwide. In Montana, FCR is caused primarily by Fusarium culmorum and F pseudograminearum. Recently, a real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR) assay was developed for FCR using primers and probes specific for a segment of the trichodiene synthase (tri5) gene. The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of QPCR for accessing FCR severity on wheat in field experiments. In 2004 and 2005, plots of spring and durum wheat were inoculated with varying levels of F pseudograminearum oat inoculum and grown under rain-fed conditions. Two weeks prior to harvest, plants were collected from the plots and assessed for FCR severity and analyzed by QPCR for Fusarium DNA quantities. Disease severity scores (DSS) and Fusarium DNA quantities were positively correlated with each other for all three cultivars in 2004 but for only the durum cultivar in 2005 (P {\textless} 0.05). In 2004, grain yields for both spring wheat cultivars were negatively correlated with Fusarium DNA quantities (P {\textgreater} 0.05). When DSS and Fusarium DNA quantities negatively correlated with yield, both measurements were comparable in predicting yield reduction (R = -0.64 and -0.77, respectively). Results indicate that this QPCR assay is effective in measuring FCR severity in wheat.},

  abstract = {Caused by a complex of Fusarium species including F. culmorum, F. graminearum, and F. pseudograminearum, Fusarium crown rot (FCR) is an important cereal disease worldwide. For this study, Fusarium population dynamics were examined in spring wheat residues sampled from dryland field locations near Bozeman and Huntley, MT, using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) Taqman assay that detects F. culmorum, F. graminearum, and F. pseudograminearum. Between August 2005 and June 2007, Fusarium populations and residue decomposition were measured eight times for standing stubble (0 to 20 cm above the soil surface), lower stem (20 to 38 cm), middle stem (38 to 66 cm), and chaff residues. Large Fusarium populations were found in stubble collected in August 2005 from F. pseudograminearum-inoculated plots. These populations declined rapidly over the next 8 months. Remnant Fusarium populations in inoculated stubble were stable relative to residue biomass from April 2006 until June 2007. These two phases of population dynamics were observed at both locations. Relative to inoculated stubble populations, Fusarium populations in other residue fractions and from noninoculated plots were small. In no case were FCR species observed aggressively colonizing noninfested residues based on qPCR data. These results suggest that Fusarium populations are unstable in the first few months after harvest and do not expand into noninfested wheat residues. Fusarium populations remaining after 8 months were stable for at least another 14 months in standing stubble providing significant inoculums for newly sown crops.},

Pereyra et al. (28) examined the survival of F. graminearum on decomposing wheat residues that were either buried or left on the soil surface using culturing techniques. F. graminearum colonization decreased over time in direct relationship to residue decomposition. After 2 years, buried stem residues were 99{\%} degraded while surface residues were 75{\%} degraded. Recovery of F. graminearum from buried residues was half that of surface residues. This Taqman assay, based on the trichodiene synthase gene (tri5), specifically detects the three primary FCR species in Montana, F. culmorum, F. graminearum, and F. pseudograminearum. To monitor inhibition in the qPCR reactions (11), all undiluted DNA samples were spiked with 335 pg of plasmid containing the $\beta$-actin gene (mjba-1) from Meloidogyne javanica (26). The primary goal was to establish baseline population dynamicsfor FCR pathogens in wheat residues under conditions typical ofMontana's wheat production systems using a previously developed qPCR assay (15,40). Additionally, this study provided an initial assessment of colonization of uninfested residues by FCR species during noncropping periods and the impacts that recently adopted solid-stem cultivars used for controlling wheat stem sawfly (Cephus cinctus) may have on Fusarium survival Cultivars also did not differ in total biomass for noninoculated or inoculated plots.

[ Therefore I assume there would be no difference between isolates having cultivar preferance,,,,, however the technique to determine isolate difference should be checked ] Fusarium populations in inoculated stubble residues at both Bozeman (P over two locations and 22 months of this study, therewas no significant saprophytic colonization of residues bydetectable members of the FCR complex as Fusarium populationsremained low throughout. Thus, residue fractions, if not colonizedpathogenically, do not appear to act as a resource base for populationexpansion. Therefore there is no evidence that solid stemsact as better reservoirs for FCR species through noncroppingcycles. Studies by others have shown that FCR development is the resultof high spring moisture followed by low late season moisture.Bottlenecks in either spring or late season conditions can dramaticallyeffect disease development (4,6). [ i.e. a wet start to the season followed by a dry finish to the growing season is condusive to high CR disease index]},

  abstract = {To identify future impacts on biomass production and yield quality of important C 3 crops, spring wheat was grown in association with 13 weed species in a Mini-FACE (free-air carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment) system under ambient (375 mu l l(-1)) and elevated (526 mu l l(-1)) CO2 concentrations. Wheat productivity was assessed at maturity and grain yield was subjected to various chemical analyses and baking quality tests. CO2 enrichment, acted as carbon 'fertiliser' and increased the aboveground biomass production of wheat by 18.8{\%} as there was a trend towards higher stein biomass. Although not statistically significant, wheat grain yield was increased by 13.4{\%} due to a significant establishment of more grains per unit ground area. At the same time, thousand grain weight was non-significantly shifted towards smaller grain size classes, which may result in negative consequences for the crop market value. As a result of the CO2-induced physiological and biochemical modifications, concentration of total grain protein was significantly decreased by 3.5{\%}, reducing the wheat grain quality with potentially far-reaching impacts on the nutritional value and use for processing industry. Although often not significant, the concentrations of amino acids per unit of flour were decreased by 0.2 to 8.3{\%} due to elevated CO2 thereby affecting the composition of proteinogenic amino acids. Furthermore, gluten proteins tended to decline. Within the significant decreased gliadins, alpha- and omega 5-gliadins were significantly reduced under CO2 enrichment; there was also a negative trend for omega 1,2- and gamma-gliadins. Changes in certain essential minerals were found as well, although not statistically significant. Concentrations of sodium, calcium, phosphorus and sulphur were slightly lowered and those of potassium and magnesium were slightly increased due to CO2 enrichment. The micro-element molybdenum was increased, while concentrations of iron, zinc, copper, manganese and aluminium were decreased. With regard to rheological and baking parameters defining the cereal quality for industrial processing, the resistance of the dough was significantly reduced by about 30{\%}, while the extensibility was non-significantly increased by 17.1{\%} under CO2 enrichment. Moreover, the bread volume was decreased non-significantly by about 9{\%}. Elevated CO2 is obviously affecting grain characteristics important for consumer nutrition and health, industrial processing and marketing. Experimental evidence for these changes is still poor but deserves further attention.},

  abstract = {Spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. TRISO) was grown for three consecutive seasons in a free-air carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment (FACE) field experiment in order to examine the effects on crop yield and grain quality. CO2 enrichment promoted aboveground biomass (+11.8{\%}) and grain yield (+10.4{\%}). However, adverse effects were predominantly observed on wholegrain quality characteristics. Although the thousand-grain weight remained unchanged, size distribution was significantly shifted towards smaller grains, which may directly relate to lower market value. Total grain protein concentration decreased significantly by 7.4{\%} under elevated CO2, and protein and amino acid composition were altered. Corresponding to the decline in grain protein concentration, CO2 enrichment resulted in an overall decrease in amino acid concentrations, with greater reductions in non-essential than essential amino acids. Minerals such as potassium, molybdenum and lead increased, while manganese, iron, cadmium and silicon decreased, suggesting that adjustments of agricultural practices may be required to retain current grain quality standards. The concentration of fructose and fructan, as well as amounts per area of total and individual non-structural carbohydrates, except for starch, significantly increased in the grain. The same holds true for the amount of lipids. With regard to mixing and rheological properties of the flour, a significant increase in gluten resistance under elevated CO2 was observed. CO2 enrichment obviously affected grain quality characteristics that are important for consumer nutrition and health, and for industrial processing and marketing, which have to date received little attention.},

  abstract = {Spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L cv. Triso) was grown in a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) field experiment in order to gain information on CO2-induced effects on grain composition and quality at maturity. A proteome analysis was performed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and protein identification was done with mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In elevated CO2 (526 mu l l(-1)), an increase of 13.5{\%} in grain yield was observed relative to 375 mu l l(-1) at a low level of significance (P = 0.528). Total grain protein concentration was decreased by 3.5{\%} at a high level of statistical significance. Most importantly, a number of statistically significant changes within the grain proteome were observed, as the levels of 32 proteins were affected by elevated CO2: 16 proteins were up-regulated and 16 were down-regulated. Our experiment demonstrates that high-CO2 can markedly affect the proteome of mature wheat grain. The potential role of the proteins, changed in response to CO2 enrichment, is discussed as some may affect grain quality. For the task of selecting cultivars resistant to CO2-induced quality loss, we propose to consider the proteins affected by elevated CO2 identified in this work here. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Samples for analysis were drawn before storage and at intervals of 6-8 weeks to determine the mycotoxin contents, seed health and seed quality. Zearalcnone (ZEA) accumulated to higher kernel contents towards the end of storage, when the seed was stored under warm and humid conditions [25{$^{\circ}$}C/90{\%} relative humidity (RH)], whereas the deoxynivalenol (DON) content of severely infected kernel samples ({\textgreater} 50{\%}) remained unchanged under any of the conditions. On the other hand, DON contents increased in samples with a slight (4{\%}) or moderate (15{\%}) Fusarium infection level. when the seed was stored under Warm and humid conditions.

During storage, the mycotoxin contents of the samples did not reflect the percentage of Fusarium infected kernels. Under warm but dry conditions (25{$^{\circ}$}C/62{\%} RH) the seed germination rate showed a slight increase or remained nearly constant; at the same time the Fusarium infection level of the kernels decreased fairly fast. Cool and dry conditions (15{$^{\circ}$}C/56{\%} RH) maintained good seed quality but the Fusarium infection level of the kernels remained largely the same. Warm and humid conditions are not appropriate to maintaining quality of both seed and grain product.

However, due to the technical difficulty in obtaining fertilizable eggs and the unavailability of embryonic stem cells, no transgenic dog has been generated. Canine fetal fibroblasts were stably transfected with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene-expressing construct using retrovirus gene delivery method. Somatic cell nuclear transfer was then employed to replace the nucleus of an oocyte with the nucleus of the RFP-fibroblasts. Using this approach, we produced the first generation of transgenic dogs with four female and two male expressing RFP.},

  year      = {2007},
  abstract  = {The strong trends in climate change already evident, the likelihood of further changes occurring, and the increasing scale of potential climate impacts give urgency to addressing agricultural adaptation more coherently. There are many potential adaptation options available for marginal change of existing agricultural systems, often variations of existing climate risk management. We show that implementation of these options is likely to have substantial benefits under moderate climate change for some cropping systems. However, there are limits to their effectiveness under more severe climate changes. Hence, more systemic changes in resource allocation need to be considered, such as targeted diversification of production systems and livelihoods. We argue that achieving increased adaptation action will necessitate integration of climate change-related issues with other risk factors, such as climate variability and market risk, and with other policy domains, such as sustainable development. Dealing with the many barriers to effective adaptation will require a comprehensive and dynamic policy approach covering a range of scales and issues, for example, from the understanding by farmers of change in risk profiles to the establishment of efficient markets that facilitate response strategies. Science, too, has to adapt. Multidisciplinary problems require multidisciplinary solutions, i.e., a focus on integrated rather than disciplinary science and a strengthening of the interface with decision makers. A crucial component of this approach is the implementation of adaptation assessment frameworks that are relevant, robust, and easily operated by all stakeholders, practitioners, policymakers, and scientists. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

  abstract = {Elevation in atmospheric CO2 concentration broadly affects plant phenology and physiology, and these effects may alter the performance of plant viruses. The effects of elevated CO2 on the susceptibility of tomato plants to Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) were examined for two successive years in open top chambers (OTC) in the field. We experimentally tested the hypothesis that elevated CO2 would reduce the incidence and severity of TYLCV on tomato by altering plant defence strategies. Our results showed that elevated CO2 decreased TYLCV disease incidence (by 14.6{\%} in 2009 and 11.8{\%} in 2010) and decreased disease severity (by 20.0{\%} in 2009 and 10.4{\%} in 2010). Elevated CO2 also decreased the level of TYLCV coat protein in tomato leaves. Regardless of virus infection, elevated CO2 increased plant height and aboveground biomass. Additionally, elevated CO2 increased the leaf C:N ratio of tomato, but decreased soluble protein content in leaves. Notably, elevated CO2 increased the salicylic acid (SA) level in uninfected and infected plants. In contrast, elevated CO2 reduced jasmonic acid (JA) in uninfected plants while it increased JA and abscisic acid (ABA) in virus-infected plants. Furthermore, combined exogenous SA and JA application enhanced resistance to TYLCV more than application of either SA or JA alone. Our results suggest that the modulated antagonistic relationship between SA and JA under elevated CO2 makes a great contribution to increased tomato resistance to TYLCV, and the predicted increases in tomato productivity may be enhanced by reduced plant virus susceptibility under projected rising CO2 conditions.},

Leaves were inoculated with ascospores or conidia of Leptosphaeria maculans carrying the effector gene AvrLm6. Incubation period to the onset of lesion development, number of lesions and lesion diameter were assessed. Symptomless growth of L. maculans from leaf lesions to stems was investigated using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing isolate carrying AvrLm6. L. maculans produced large grey lesions on Darmor (lacking Rlm6) at 5-25 degrees C and DarmorMX (carrying Rlm6) at 25 degrees C, but small dark spots and 'green islands' on DarmorMX at 5-20 degrees C. With increasing temperature/wetness duration, numbers of lesions/spots generally increased. GFP-expressing L. maculans grew from leaf lesions down leaf petioles to stems on DarmorMX at 25 degrees C but not at 15 degrees C. We conclude that temperature and leaf wetness duration affect the phenotypic expression of Rlm6-mediated resistance in leaves and subsequent L. maculans spread down petioles to produce stem cankers.},

The duration of ascospore release was longer in England, where winter weather is mild and wet, than in Poland, where winters are cold and often with snow cover, but there was little difference between two sites in England (Rothamsted and Boxworth). Wetness provided by rainfall was essential for release of ascospores of both L. maculans in England and L. biglobosa in Poland. Temperature did not affect release of ascospores over the range 5-20{\&}DEG; C. Diurnal periodicity in release of ascospores of L. maculans in England and L. biglobosa in Poland was similar. The timing (date) of first release of ascospores of L. maculans or L. biglobosa in autumn was related to rainfall in August and September; with increasing rainfall the date was earlier. The incubation periods from first release of ascospores to first appearance of phoma leaf spots for both L. maculans in England and L. biglobosa in Poland, and from first leaf spots to first stem base canker in England, were described using a thermal time (degree-day) approximation.},

  abstract = {Reducing the tillage and application of mulch are important strategies for soil and water conservation and sustainability of agricultural systems. Soil can be a source or sink for carbon (C) depending on management strategies and plays a major role in the global C cycle. These interacting practices can alter nutrient movement and availability to the crops, reduce water loss, slow down organic-matter (OM) decomposition, and thus enhance C sequestration. A 2-year field study was conducted to quantify the tillage and mulching effect on soil organic C (SOC), OM, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) at two depths (i.e., 0-15 and 15-30 cm deep) in the soil profile and N, P, and K concentrations (g kg-1) in plant shoots at harvest on a Typic Calciargids in wheat-maize rotation. The four tillage systems used were zero tillage (ZT), minimum tillage (MT), conventional tillage (CT), and deep tillage (DT), and four mulch rates [control, 2 (M2), 4 (M4), and 6 (M6) Mg ha-1 year-1 wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw] were applied in combination with each tillage system, keeping recommended rates of fertilizers. There was a linear positive response of mulch application on SOC for both years, but it was more pronounced during the second year. Greater values were found in ZT and the lowest in CT at all depths, although greater SOC content was found in upper layers than in deeper ones. Greater shoot N, P, and K concentrations were found in MT, CT, and DT, whereas the lowest concentration was found in ZT. Mulch application has no effect on N, P, and K concentrations in shoots. The soil N concentration was not affected by tillage and mulch, yet greater soil N content was found at 0-15 cm than 15-30 cm deep. There was significant effect of tillage on soil P and K during one year as greater P and K concentrations were found under MT, CT, and DT compared to ZT. More N, P, K, and OM concentrations were found at 0-15 cm deep than at 15-30 cm deep during the whole study period. Mulch effect was significant on K, and significantly greater amounts were found at greater levels of mulch application. The increases in the soil OM were 34.5, 35.75, and 24{\%} at 0-8, 8-16, and 16-24 cm deep respectively from the first year to the second year. Tillage effect on soil organic-matter content was not significant. Tillage increased grain production for both years. For the first year, 22.9 and 27{\%} greater yields were found in CT and DT, whereas in the second year yields were 10.6, 17.9, and 57{\%} greater, respectively, in MT, CT, and DT as compared to ZT. Grain production was increased at a result of mulch application by 12.9, 20.3, and 10.6{\%} during the first year and 11.45, 23.74, and 10.9{\%} during the second year as compared to control (i.e., without mulch). Results show the importance of mulch application and crop residue retention. Both can increase the SOC content and water-holding capacity, which will result in improved production and soil physical health over long and continuous use of mulch.},

Field trials were set up in the varietal testing network of Flanders Agricultural Centre for Small Grains (Roeselare 2013 Beitem, Belgium) and followed up during growing seasons 200120132002, 200220132003, 200320132004 and 200420132005. Fusarium infection and DON contamination were mainly influenced by location and environmental parameters. Mean DON levels ranged from 0 to 15{}mg/kg. Over the period of four growing seasons cvs Deben, Ordeal and Napier had the highest DON contamination. Seasonal and local weather conditions before and during flowering together with local crop husbandry measures (crop rotation, soil preparation) seemed to be of great importance in explaining the variation in results obtained. At Bottelare a positive correlation between disease index and DON content was found for the growing seasons 200120132002 and 200220132003, but not the season 200320132004. Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum were in general the most frequently occurring Fusarium spp. in Flanders over the 4{}years but the composition of the Fusarium population varied strongly from location to location and from year to year. Fusarium graminearum predominated in areas especially where maize was cultivated, whereas in areas with more small cereals in the crop rotation more F. culmorum was present.

  abstract = {From 2002 to 2008, 203 samples of wheat, maize, soybean, and pea were analysed for the presence of Fusarium species. Contamination with Fusarium spp., expressed as the percentage of seeds with Fusarium colonies, ranged from 5{\%} to 69{\%} for wheat, from 25{\%} to 100{\%} for maize, from 4{\%} to 17{\%} for soybean, and from 3{\%} to 17{\%} for pea. 187 isolates were collected and the following 19 species determined: F. graminearum, F. poae, F. avenaceum, F. verticillioides, F. sporotrichioides, F. heterosporum, F. crookwellense, F. tricinctum, F. semitectum, F. oxysporum, F. proliferatum, F. solani, F. equiseti, F. pseudograminearum, F. chlamydosporum, F. sambucinum, F. compactum, F. scirpi, and F. culmorum. Dominant species were F. graminearum on wheat (27{\%} of isolates), F. verticillioides on maize (83{\%} of isolates), F. sporotrichioides on soybean (34{\%} of isolates), and F. proliferatum on pea (29{\%} of isolates). Among species identified, F. heterosporum, F. crookwellense, F. pseudograminearum, F. sambucinum, and F. compactum have been reported for the first time in Croatia.},

Schollenberger et al. reportedT-2 tetraol, HT-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol (DON), andzearalenone (ZEN) in soya meal Fusarium species found on grain in this study according to Leslie and Summerell (1) can produce DON, NIV, ZEN, fumonisins (FUM), beauvericin (BEA), diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS), HT-2 toxin (HT2), T-2 toxin (T2), moniliformin (MON), and a range of other less investigated toxins (1). Exposure to these toxins can seriously affect human or animal health (5- 7, 17, 32-34). ZEN is an immunotoxic, haematotoxic, hepatotoxic, and genotoxic oestrogenic toxin (32) which can cause infertility, hyperoestrogenism or poor performance in domesticated animals (7,32), and has been implicated in hyperoestrogenic syndromes in humans (32). MON is a cytotoxic and haematotoxic toxin which can cause poor performance in livestock or mortality in animals (7), and has been suspected as a cause of human heart disorder known as Keshan disease (7). BEA is cytotoxic and can cause apoptosis of murine and human cell lines (7). FUM is a cancer-promoting hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic toxin (5, 6), and can cause fatal animal diseases like leukoencephalomalacia in horses and pulmonary oedema in swine (5). Trichothecenes like DON, NIV, DAS, HT2, or T2 are haematotoxic,cytotoxic, immunotoxic and embryotoxic (7, 33), and can cause reduced growth, postnatal mortality, foetal skeleton abnormalities, leucopenia, intrauterine growth retardation, pulmonary adenomas, or epithelial hyperplasia in animals (33, 34).},

  abstract  = {Inheritance of resistance to phosphine fumigant was investigated in three field-collected strains of rusty grain beetle, Cryptolestes ferrugineus, Susceptible (S-strain), Weakly Resistant (Weak-R) and Strongly Resistant (Strong-R). The strains were purified for susceptibility, weak resistance and strong resistance to phosphine, respectively, to ensure homozygosity of resistance genotype. Crosses were established between S-strain ?? Weak-R, S-strain ?? Strong-R and Weak-R ?? Strong-R, and the dose mortality responses to phosphine of these strains and their F1, F2 and F1-backcross progeny were obtained. The fumigations were undertaken at 25 ??C and 55{\%} RH for 72 h.Weak-R and Strong-R showed resistance factors of 6.3?? and 505?? compared with S-strain at the LC50. Both weak and strong resistances were expressed as incompletely recessive with degrees of dominance of -0.48 and -0.43 at the LC50, respectively. Responses of F2 and F1-backcross progeny indicated the existence of one major gene in Weak-R, and at least two major genes in Strong-R, one of which was allelic with the major factor in Weak-R. Phenotypic variance analyses also estimated that the number of independently segregating genes conferring weak resistance was 1 (nE = 0.89) whereas there were two genes controlling strong resistance (nE = 1.2).

as well as an additional projection with a higher spatial resolution of 1.3{}km, were used for investigating the potential WLR infection periods for two future time spans. Results showed that the infections of WLR were satisfactorily simulated during the development of wheat at both sites for the 2003--2013 period. The probabilities of WLR detection were close to 1 and the critical success index ranged from 0.80 to 0.94 (perfect score{}={}1 for both). Moreover, the highest proportions of favourable days of WLR infection were simulated during spring and summer at both sites. Regional climate projections showed an increase in temperatures by 1.6{}K for 2041--2050 and by 3.7{}K for 2091--2100 compared to the reference period 1991--2000. Positive trends in favourable WLR infection conditions occur at both sites more conducive than in the reference period due to projected climatic conditions.},

  abstract  = {Climate change will probably influence the occurrence, prevalence and severity of plant diseases. This will also affect disease management with regard to timing, preference and efficacy of chemical, physical and biological measures of control and their utilization within integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. Prediction of future requirements in disease management is of great interest for agroindustries, extension services and practical farmers. A comprehensive analysis of potential climate-change effects on disease control is difficult because current knowledge is limited and fragmented. This review reveals that certain existing preventive plant protection measures, such as use of a diversity of crop species in cropping systems, adjustment of sowing or planting dates, use of crop cultivars with superior resistance and/or tolerance to diseases and abiotic stress, use of reliable tools to forecast disease epidemics, application of IPM strategies, and effective quarantine systems, may become particularly important in the future. Effective crop protection technologies are available and will provide appropriate tools to adapt to altered climatic conditions, although the complexity of future risks for plant disease management may be considerable, particularly if new crops are introduced in an area. Overall, the challenge of adapting disease control measures to climate change is not likely to be fundamentally different from the adjustments to technological innovations or changes in the economic framework already required in current crop protection. Potential beneficial effects of climate change, such as longer growing seasons, fewer frosts and shifted precipitation patterns, must not be neglected, as they could counteract the presumed enhancement of particular diseases.},

  abstract = {Climate change biology is witnessing a significant quantity of new publications each year, which compromises efforts to keep up-to-date on the rapidly growing body of climate change biology literature. The present paper provides an overview on research approaches and challenges in climate change biology with respect to plant pathogens, insect pests and weeds (collectively termed 'pests' here). It also summarizes the suggestions of researchers about how to conceptualize and prioritize future research strategies. Recently published key studies demonstrate that climate change research is qualitatively advancing and that the interactions among environmental and biotic factors which have been found are complex. This complexity hinders attempts to generalize responses of pests to changes in climate. The challenge remains to identify the most significant causal relationships and to separate them from other factors such as crop management practices, which may also influence the observed changes in pest distribution and prevalence in managed ecosystems. In addition, the present overview shows that there are still gaps in many research areas, while other fields have been intensively investigated. For example, the identification of potential benefits in plant protection that may emerge from future climate change has not been explored as extensively as the potential threats. However, encouraging developments can be observed in recent climate change research, for instance the increased number of studies performed under subtropical and tropical climatic conditions, the increased availability of results from multi-factorial field experiments and modelling studies do consider increasingly pest-crop-climate interactions. Further progress can be expected, provided that researchers, sponsors and other stakeholders maintain their interest in climate change biology research.},

  abstract = {This review summarizes the most significant results from the so far existing, but fragmented studies on the potential effects of climate change on wheat pathogens and the diseases they cause. The analysis demonstrates that predictions are uncertain and future disease risk trends must be differentiated on a geographic and time scale. For example, disease incidence of Fusarium head blight in the United Kingdom might increase middle of this century, whereas disease severity of Septoria tritici blotch might decrease in France end of this century. Thus, wheat disease problems caused by a changing climate will probably not consistently worsen, as climatic changes may also improve the crop health situation in wheat depending on the location. The results of long-term simulations of future disease risk must be taken with caution, because different climate models and downscaling methods are used to make the projections and this can create considerable uncertainty. Being aware of this short-coming, plant pathologists recently started to assess the sources of uncertainty related to their long-term disease simulations. However, in spite of this progress there is still a significant lack of simulation studies related to different wheat diseases in various locations that could help to estimate future wheat grain losses due to climatic changes. Many more of these studies are certainly needed. Otherwise, the focus in the climate change debate will remain on the yield loss/gain potential due to changes in the environmental conditions only, which would neglect the important impact of altered biotic constraints such as diseases which are among the key factors in the estimation of future global wheat productivity.},

  abstract  = {Agricultural systems are increasingly managed for improving soil carbon (C) accumulation. However, there are limits to C returns in agricultural systems that constrain soil C accumulation capacity. Increasing the efficiency of how soil microbes process C is gaining interest as an important management strategy for increasing soil C and is a key feature of soil C dynamics in many new microbial-explicit models. A higher microbial C use efficiency (CUE) may increase C storage while reducing C system losses and is a fundamental trait affecting community assembly dynamics and nutrient cycling. However, the numerous ecological unknowns influencing CUE limit our ability to effectively manage CUE in agricultural soils for greater soil C storage. In this perspective, we consider three complex drivers of agroecosystem CUE that need to be resolved to develop effective C sequestration management practices in the future: 1) the environment as an individual trait moderator versus a filter, 2) microbial community competitive and faciliatory interactions, and 3) spatio-temporal dynamics through the soil profile and across the microbial lifecycle. We highlight ways that amendments, crop rotations, and tillage practices might affect microbial CUE conditions and the variable outcomes of these practices. We argue that to resolve some of the unknowns of CUE dynamics we need to include more mechanistic, trait-based approaches that capitalize on advanced methods and innovative field research designs within an agroecosystem specific context. By identifying the management-level determinants of CUE expression, we will be better positioned to optimize CUE to increase soil C storage in agricultural systems.},

A mycological survey carried out throughout these regions, revealed that 78{\%} of the prospected fields were infested. Results of the morphological and molecular identification, showed that the most common species isolated from diseased wheat spikes was Microdochium nivale var. nivale (63.5{\%}), followed by Fusarium culmorum (26{\%}), F. pseudograminearum (9{\%}) and F. avenaceum (1.5{\%}). To evaluate mycotoxin content of naturally infected grain, the amounts of trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) in harvested grain from 45 fields were quantified by RIDASCREEN DON Enzyme Immunoassay Kit (ELISA). This study showed that the infection levels in freshly harvested grain were very low and the maximum deoxynivalenol (DON) level of the positive samples was 53 ppb. This is the first report on the natural occurrence of DON in naturally infected wheat grain sampled from Northern Tunisia.},

Fusarium graminearum infection causes significant crop and quality losses. In addition to roles as virulence factors during pathogenesis, trichothecene mycotoxins (e.g. deoxynivalenol) produced by this pathogen constitute a significant threat to human and animal health if consumed in respective food or feed products. In the last few years, significant progress has been made towards a better understanding of the processes involved in F. graminearum pathogenesis, toxin biosynthesis and host resistance mechanisms through the use of high-throughput genomic and phenomic technologies. In this article, we briefly review these new advances and also discuss how future research can contribute to the development of sustainable plant protection strategies against this important plant pathogen.},

  abstract = {The constant struggle between plants and microbes has driven the evolution of multiple defense strategies in the host as well as offense strategies in the pathogen. To defend themselves from pathogen attack, plants often rely on elaborate signaling networks regulated by phytohormones. In turn, pathogens have adopted innovative strategies to manipulate phytohormone-regulated defenses. Tactics frequently employed by plant pathogens involve hijacking, evading, or disrupting hormone signaling pathways and/or crosstalk. As reviewed here, this is achieved mechanistically via pathogen-derived molecules known as effectors, which target phytohormone receptors, transcriptional activators and repressors, and other components of phytohormone signaling in the host plant. Herbivores and sap-sucking insects employ obligate pathogens such as viruses, phytoplasma, or symbiotic bacteria to intervene with phytohormone-regulated defenses. Overall, an improved understanding of phytohormone intervention strategies employed by pests and pathogens during their interactions with plants will ultimately lead to the development of new crop protection strategies.},

  abstract  = {Elevated levels of atmospheric CO2are predicted to contribute to major climatic changes during the next 50--100 years. This can have a significant impact on future food security if such changes make crop plants vulnerable to biotic and abiotic stresses. Indeed, a growing body of recent studies highlighted in this review show that elevated CO2(eCO2) directly and/or indirectly influence plant-biotic interactions. In many instances, eCO2alters phytohormone and reactive oxygen signalling, secondary metabolism as well as defence-associated development such as stomatal responses in the host. eCO2can also directly and/or indirectly influence pathogenesis- and herbivory-related traits in pest and pathogen populations although currently very little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in such effects. In addition, eCO2alters predator-prey interactions by interfering with indirect defences and chemical communications in insect pests. A better understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in plant-biotic interactions under eCO2will be critical towards mitigation of potentially adverse effects of climate change on crop production.},

  abstract  = {The cereal pathogen Fusarium graminearum is the primary cause of Fusarium head blight (FHB) and a significant threat to food safety and crop production. To elucidate population structure and identify genomic targets of selection within major FHB pathogen populations in North America we sequenced the genomes of 60 diverse F. graminearum isolates. We also assembled the first pan-genome for F. graminearum to clarify population-level differences in gene content potentially contributing to pathogen diversity. Bayesian and phylogenomic analyses revealed genetic structure associated with isolates that produce the novel NX-2 mycotoxin, suggesting a North American population that has remained genetically distinct from other endemic and introduced cereal-infecting populations. Genome scans uncovered distinct signatures of selection within populations, focused in high diversity, frequently recombining regions. These patterns suggested selection for genomic divergence at the trichothecene toxin gene cluster and thirteen additional regions containing genes potentially involved in pathogen specialization. Gene content differences further distinguished populations, in that 121 genes showed population-specific patterns of conservation. Genes that differentiated populations had predicted functions related to pathogenesis, secondary metabolism and antagonistic interactions, though a subset had unique roles in temperature and light sensitivity. Our results indicated that F. graminearum populations are distinguished by dozens of genes with signatures of selection and an array of dispensable accessory genes, suggesting that FHB pathogen populations may be equipped with different traits to exploit the agroecosystem. These findings provide insights into the evolutionary processes and genomic features contributing to population divergence in plant pathogens, and highlight candidate genes for future functional studies of pathogen specialization across evolutionarily and ecologically diverse fungi.},

Disease incidence, severity, deoxynivalenol and Fusarium biomass were assessed after each cycle in microcosms established at ambient and 700 mg kg-1 CO2 using soil and stubble of these wheat lines from a field experiment with free to air CO2 enrichment. Monoconidial isolates from wheat stubble were collected initially, and after five cropping cycles, to compare the frequency and aggressiveness of Fusarium species in the two populations. Aggressiveness was measured using a high-throughput seedling bioassay. At elevated CO2, the higher initial incidence in Tamaroi increased with cropping cycles, but incidence in 249 remained unchanged. Incidence at ambient CO2 did not change for either line. Elevated CO2 induced partial resistance in Tamaroi, but not in 249. Increased Fusarium biomass in wheat tissue at elevated CO2 matched raised deoxynivalenol of the stem base in both lines. After five cycles of continuous wheat cropping, aggressiveness increased in pathogenic F. culmorum and F. pseudograminearum by 110{\%}, but decreased in weakly pathogenic F. equiseti and F. oxysporum by 50{\%}. CO2 and host resistance interactively influenced species frequency, and the highly aggressive F. pseudograminearum became dominant on Tamaroi irrespective of CO2 concentration, while its frequency declined on 249. This study shows that induced resistance at elevated CO2 will not reduce crown rot severity, or impede the selection and enrichment of Fusarium populations with increased aggressiveness.},

  abstract = {Plant-pathogenic fungi produce an array of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes that enable them to penetrate and infect the host tissue; these enzymes are collectively called cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDE). They may contribute to pathogenesis by degrading wax, cuticle and cell walls, thus aiding tissue invasion and pathogen dissemination. Furthermore, they can act as elicitors of host defense reaction.Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a disease caused principally by Fusarium graminearum on crops, occurring all over the world. Important economic losses on wheat-growing areas have been registered by altering quality parameters of grains. Significant progress has been made in understanding the infection process from F. graminearum on wheat, based on genomic technologies. The virulence degree of this phytopathogen on crops could arise from differences in the production of extracellular enzymes, factors controlling the establishment of infection.Fusarium graminearum isolates from different geographical areas have been examined, and a combination of morphological and molecular data allowed the division of fungi in diverse groups, which have been related to the variation in pathogenicity. In most studied cases there is a correlation between the presence of pectic enzymes, disease symptom and virulence, being also their production decisive in the infection process.

  abstract = {The effect of previous crops (oilseed, legume, and cereal) on the incidence and severity of crown rot ( Fusarium pseudograminearum, Fp) and yield of wheat was investigated in 3 field studies in northern New South Wales. The experiments were designed to compare the effectiveness of the Brassica break crops canola ( Brassica napus L.) and mustard ( B. juncea L.) with chickpea ( Cicer arietinum L.) on reduction of Fp in subsequent wheat crops. Responses to previous broadleaf and cereal crops were investigated in Fp-tolerant bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) and Fp-susceptible durum wheat [ Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum (Dest.)]. In all experiments, broadleaf break crops increased the yield of Fp-susceptible durum wheat compared with durum after cereals ( by 0.24 - 0.89 t/ha). The same response was observed for the Fp-tolerant wheat at 2 of the 3 sites (0.71 and 0.78 t/ha), with a lower yield (0.13 t/ha) after break crops than after cereals at one site during a drought. The yield of the Fp-susceptible durum wheat was generally higher after brassicas than after chickpea ( yield advantage 0.27 - 0.58 t/ha), whereas there was no such difference in the tolerant wheat variety. In most cases, these yield responses to the previous crops were closely related to the severity of Fp infection. Overall yield of susceptible durum wheat was reduced by 1{\%} for each 1{\%} increase in Fp severity at harvest. Residual water and nitrogen (N) did not explain responses to previous crops, although common root rot ( Bipolaris sorokiniana) may have contributed to some of the responses at the sites. There was little evidence that the lower disease and higher yield following brassicas compared with chickpea was related to suppression of Fp by biofumigation. More plausible explanations are that residual cereal residues decomposed more rapidly under dense Brassica canopies thus reducing Fp inoculum, that Fp severity was increased following chickpea due to higher soil N status, or that brassicas resulted in soil/residue biology that was less conducive to Fp inoculum survival. Evidence for the latter was provided by consistently higher levels of Trichoderma spp. isolated from wheat following brassicas compared with chickpea or cereals. Irrespective of the mechanisms involved, the results demonstrate that Brassica oilseeds provide an effective break crop for crown rot in northern NSW. Furthermore, brassicas may provide an excellent alternative rotation crop to chickpea for high value durum wheat due to an apparent capacity to more effectively reduce the severity of crown rot infection in subsequent crops.},

  abstract  = {Histopathological assessment of infection by the crown rot pathogen Fusarium pseudograminearum in wheat seedling tissues was performed using fluorescence microscopy. The coleoptiles and leaf sheaths of four host cultivars of differing susceptibility were examined. Leaf sheaths were most frequently penetrated via stomata, indicated by initial lesions forming at the guard cells. Internally, cell wall penetration was facilitated by penetration structures which appeared as hyphal swellings or septate foot-shaped appressoria. Colonization of leaf sheaths resulted in the re-emergence of hyphae from stomata on both surfaces of the sheath. These hyphae are hypothesized to have two major roles; first as exploratory hyphae for colonization of new tissues, and secondly as sites of profuse conidial production. The formation of conidia on the leaf sheath surface was only recorded on the most susceptible bread wheat genotype. No other major differences in host--pathogen interactions were observed among these cultivars. Almost all cell types in the leaf sheath tissues were extensively colonized, except for the vascular bundles and silica cells. This investigation provides the first comprehensive assessment of F.{}pseudograminearum infection structures and growth patterns during the infection of wheat seedlings.},

There was symptom and colonisation of the leaf blades, however this was insignificant compared to stem infection. Authors interpretation of data Lesion edges on the leaf blade typically had slim chlorotic margins. While visual discolouration could affect 100 {\%} of the tissue of a leaf sheath, visual assessments frequently indicated a cessation of symptom development at the ligule of that leaf (Fig. 1b). Leaf senecence was not a predictable feature of infection. Due to the lack of uniformity of symptoms, colonisation and tissues of primary roots, secondary roots and sub-crown internodes the correlations between visual symptoms and fungal biomass have only been reported for leaf tissues (Fig. 5). CONSISTANT WITH FINDINGS BY MELLOY, OBANOR AND CHAKRABORTY In addition, the observation of green and apparently healthy leaf blades attached to entirely discoloured leaf sheaths supports the observations of Knight and Sutherland (2013), which indicate that vascular tissues of seedling leaf sheaths are not colonised by F. pseudograminearum and thus may still be supplying the leaf blade with water and mineral nutrients.

This study is the first to investigate the relationship between the widely used visual rating of seedling leaf sheath discoloration and the degree of colonization of these tissues by the pathogen, based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of fungal DNA using primers specific for the translation elongation factor $\alpha$ sequence. Fourteen-day-old seedlings of four hard white spring wheat genotypes which differ in their degree of resistance to the pathogen, based on the expression of visible symptoms, were inoculated using a droplet method and assessed weekly from 7 to 35 days after inoculation (dai) for both discoloration and fungal DNA content per unit of tissue weight. Both visual assessment of disease symptoms and qPCR of fungal biomass indicated significant differences between the partially resistant and susceptible wheat genotypes from 14 dai. Visual discoloration of leaf sheath tissues was strongly correlated with fungal biomass estimated by qPCR in all four genotypes; however, this correlation became weaker with increasing time after inoculation. Significant correlations between these parameters were indicated at 14, 21, and 28 dai whereas, by 35 dai, the correlation was not significant. Evaluation of plants at 14 dai provided a rapid test which gave clear discrimination between lines for both parameters and was the time point of closest correlation between fungal colonization and disease symptoms. Symptom expression at all times following inoculation was accompanied by tissue infection, and at no time was symptomless infection observed under this screening environment. These qPCR results confirm that visual assessments of disease symptoms reflect the extent of tissue colonization by the pathogen in recently colonized tissues and confirm the validity of visual assessments for disease rating in high-throughput screening of breeding materials.

  abstract = {Agricultural system simulation models are key tools for assessment of possible impacts of climate change on crop production and environmental quality. In this study, the CERES-Wheat 4.0 module in the RZWQM2 model was calibrated and validated for simulating spring wheat grown under elevated CO2 conditions in the FACE (Free Air CO2 Enrichment) experiments conducted at Maricopa, Arizona, USA from 1992 to 1997. The validated model was then used to simulate the possible impacts of climate change on the crop for a 16-year period centered on 2050 with a projected atmospheric CO2 concentration of 550 ppm. Sixteen General Circulation Model (GCM) projections of climate in response to this CO2 concentration were used for this purpose. In the FACE experiment, the crops were grown under ambient (365-370 ppm) and elevated (similar to 550 ppm) CO2 concentrations with two irrigation treatments (wet and dry) in 1992-1993 and 1993-1994, and two nitrogen (N) treatments (high and low N) in 1995-1996 and 1996-1997 crop seasons. The model simulated crop growth and grain yield, and soil water responses to CO2 reasonably well, reproducing variations due to the treatments. Under ambient CO2 in 1992-1993 and 1995-1996, biomass was simulated better in the dry and low N treatments with root mean square difference (RMSD) of 181 and 161 kg ha(-1), respectively, compared to the wet and high N treatments with RMSD of 259 and 268 kg ha(-1), respectively. The effects of water and N treatments were higher than those of CO2, and the model reproduced these effects well. Elevated CO2 effects on crop growth were counterbalanced by temperature effects, and projected precipitation had little effect on the simulated crop. The model results provide reasonable confidence for simulations of possible impacts of projected climate change on wheat crop growth in the region, within normal field data uncertainties.

With free-air CO2 enrichnient (FACE), rice plants were grown in ambient and elevated (approximate to 200 to 280 mu mol mol(-1) above ambient) CO2 concentrations, and were artificially inoculated with consist of Magnaporthe oryzae. Rice plants grown in an elevated CO2 concentration were more susceptible to leaf blast than those in ambient CO2 as, indicated by the increased number of leaf blast lesions. Plains grown Under elevated CO2 concentration had lower leaf silicon content, which may have contributed to the increased Susceptibility to leaf blast under elevated CO2 concentrations. In contrast to leaf blast, panicle blast severity wits unchanged by the CO2 enrichment under artificial inoculation, whereas it was slightly but significantly higher under elevated CO2 concentrations in a spontaneous rice blast epidemic. For naturally Occurring epidemics of the sheath blight development in rice plants, the percentage of diseased plants was higher under elevated as opposed to ambient CO2 concentrations. However, the average height of lesions above the soil Surface was similar between the treatments. One hypothesis is that the higher number of filters observed under elevated CO2 concentrations may have increased the Chance for fungal sclerotia to adhere to the leaf sheath at the water surface. Consequently, the potential risks for infection of leaf blast Would increase in rice grown under and epidemics of sheath blight elevated CO2 concentration.},

  abstract = {Foot rot and crown rot are fungal diseases of wheat caused by a complex of Fusarium species. They have a huge economic impact mainly due to yield reduction. A survey was conducted to identify four Fusarium species, occurring on wheat stem bases, using species-specific PCR assays in samples collected during spring of 2012. The dominant species was F. graminearum, which was identified in above 64{}{\%} of samples. F. culmorum was detected in 15.71{}{\%}, F. poae in 15.71{}{\%} and F. sporotrichioides in 5.71{}{\%} wheat fields. Most of the wheat fields in the eastern Poland were infected with at least one or two of Fusarium species, while in central Poland no Fusarium species were identified in most of the fields. The presence of F. graminearum tends to favor the presence of F. culmorum and this effect was visible also for F. poae and F. sporotrichioides. The frequency of F. graminearum and F. culmorum detections were highest where wheat crops were preceded by maize and in the samples from late sown fields. The opposite observation was made for F. poae and F. sporotrichioides, where the number of detections of these species was higher in samples from early sown fields. The number of detected Fusarium species was significantly lower in samples collected from fields protected with autumn herbicide in comparison to unprotected fields. The rate of autumn N fertilization did not affect the number of Fusarium detections. {\textcopyright} 2014, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, causal agent of tan spot of wheat, produces a cultivar-specific toxin (Ptr ToxA) required for high virulence. Sensitive wheat lines develop necrosis within 48 h of infiltration with nM levels of purified toxin, but the mechanism by which this occurs is not understood. The involvement of wheat metabolism in the action of Ptr ToxA was investigated here with a qualitative assay based on necrosis development and a more rapid and quantitative assay based on electrolyte leakage. Necrosis and electrolyte leakage failed to develop when toxin-treated wheat was incubated at 4 degrees C, but the inhibition of toxin action by cold was reversible. Necrosis developed when wheat was exposed to toxin for 8 h at 4 degrees C, then shifted to 20 degrees C for an additional 40 h. Electrolyte leakage was delayed by only 2 h in toxin-treated leaves held at 4 degrees C for 6 h then shifted to 20 degrees C, relative to leaves held at 20 degrees C throughout. Toxin-induced electrolyte leakage was reduced by the co-application of sodium vanadate, an inhibitor of H+-ATPases. However, the level of protection from electrolyte leakage by a single application of vanadate decreased as time increased, and the inhibitor failed to prevent necrosis development. Inhibitors of transcription (alpha-amanitin and cordycepin) and of translation (cycloheximide) each reduced the level of toxin-induced electrolyte leakage. Cycloheximide was the only inhibitor that prevented necrosis development when cc-infiltrated with toxin. The data indicate that the action of Ptr ToxA requires active host processes including transcription, translation, and functional H+-ATPases. (C) 1998 Academic Press.},

Under Such conditions. there is high probability that forests will be Subject to increased frequency and intensity of stress due to climatic extremes. Therefore. impacts of climate change On forest health Should be carefully evaluated. Given these assumptions, several fungal diseases on trees may become more devastating because of the following factors: (i) abiotic Stresses. Such as drought and flooding, are known to predispose trees to several pathogens (ii) temperature and Moisture affect pathogen sporulation and dispersal. and changes in climatic conditions are likely to favour certain pathogens; (iii) migration of pathogens triggered by climatic change may increase disease incidence or geographical range, when pathogens encounter new hosts and (or) new potential vectors and (iv) new threats may appear either because of it change in tree species composition or because of invasive species. If infection success is dependent on temperature, higher mean temperatures may lead to more attacks. Pathogens that have been of importance in southern Europe may spread northward and also upward to mountains. Pathogens with evolutionary potential for greater damage Should be identified to estimate magnitude of the threat and to prepare for the changing conditions. A review of the above-mentioned cases is presented. Some priorities to improve the ability to predict impacts of climate change on tree diseases are discussed.},

Elevated carbon dioxide [ECO2] and associated climate change have the potential to accelerate plant pathogen evolution, which may, in turn, affect virulence. Plant-pathogen interactions under increasing CO2 concentrations have the potential to disrupt both agricultural and natural systems severely, yet the lack of experimental data and the subsequent ability to predict future outcomes constitutes a fundamental knowledge gap. Furthermore, nothing is known about the mechanistic bases of increasing pathogen agressiveness. In the absence of information on crop species, it is shown here that plant pathogen (Erysiphe cichoracearum) aggressiveness is increased under ECO2, together with changes in the leaf epidermal characteristics of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana L. Stomatal density, guard cell length, and trichome numbers on leaves developing post-infection are increased under ECO2 in direct contrast to non-infected responses. As many plant pathogens utilize epidermal features for successful infection, these responses provide a positive feedback mechanism facilitating an enhanced susceptibility of newly developed leaves to further pathogen attack. Furthermore, a screen of resistant and susceptible ecotypes suggest inherent differences in epidermal responses to ECO2.},

  abstract = {Displacement of pathogenic Fusarium species from cereal residues by other fungi is an important mechanism for the effectiveness of fallows and crop rotations on disease management, as well as in potential biological control. The effect of fluctuating environmental conditions on the rate of displacement was assessed using two different approaches. In the first, wetness durations between 4 and 10 h were simulated by spraying water onto straw inoculated with Fusarium pseudograminearum and antagonists in a greenhouse. For a given cumulative period of wetness, displacement of F. pseudograminearum was generally higher for short (4 h) than longer (10 h) wetting durations, indicating that it was the number of wetting events, rather than their individual durations, that determined the rate of displacement. In the second approach, exponential decay models using thermal time adjusted for rainfall were fitted to published data on survival of Fusarium species in residues. Heat sums calculated from the mean temperature of days on which rain fell, or rainday-degrees (RDD), gave good fits to data from short-term experiments on displacement of F. pseudograminearum by antagonists under natural conditions. RDD and two other indices, decomposition days (DCD) and corrected degree-days (CDD), were equally satisfactory for modelling straw decomposition and mortality of Fusarium in longer term data sets. Such models could be useful for predicting the effects of environmental variation on rotations and biocontrol for Fusarium management in cereals.},

The induction of tan necrosis is associated with the production of the Ptr-necrosis toxin by nec+ isolates of Ptr and the presence of a dominant gene for toxin sensitivity in the host. The effect of temperature on the development of tan necrosis and chlorosis was investigated using eight wheat genotypes differing in reaction to tan spot and three isolates from the three currently available virulent pathotypes of Ptr. The following constant temperature regimes were tested: 10, 15, 20, 22, 25, 27, and 30 degrees C. At 27 and 30 degrees C, a clear change towards resistance, both necrotic and chlorotic, was observed in the susceptible genotypes. Reaction types of the same lines/cultivars were not altered at temperatures of 25 degrees C or below. Throughout this study, no breakdown of resistance was observed. Temperature-induced resistance to the fungus was paralleled by temperature-induced insensitivity to the Ptr-necrosis toxin. No symptoms were observed in toxin-infiltrated sensitive Glenlea wheat plants kept at 30 degrees C. The data of this study suggest that, in the necrotic system, the induced resistance observed at temperatures above 27 degrees C may have resulted from the failure of the toxin to interact with its putative receptor.},

Crop rotation treatments included the following crops: canola ( C), lupin ( L), medic ( M), medic-clover mixture (Mc) and wheat ( W). Rotation treatments (RT) and within-treatment crop sequences were: RT 1 = W-W-W-W, RT 2= C-W-W-W, W-C-W-W, W-W-C-W, RT 3= C-W-L-W, L-W-C-W, RT 4= W-L-C-W, L-C-W-W, RT 5=M-W-M-W, RT 6=McW- Mc-W and RT 7= M-C-M-W. Crop rotation significantly affected the incidence of F. pseudograminearum, crown rot incidence and severity, dry mass and grain yield. The incidence of F. pseudograminearum was significantly higher on wheat for the rotation treatment that included 3 years of wheat and 1 year of canola compared with the other treatments, and the highest severities and incidences of crown rot and the lowest yields were also recorded for this treatment and the monoculture wheat. The lowest incidences of the fungus, as well as crown rot incidences and severities, and the highest yields were recorded for the rotation treatment that alternated wheat with a medic-clover mixture and the treatment that included wheat after 3 years of rotation with broadleaf crops. Crop rotation should, therefore, be an important component of management strategies against crown rot of wheat.},

Prior genetic work has generally supported the conclusion that populations of this migratory species are connected by substantial gene flow. However, the present study reveals the presence of two genetically divergent lineages of this taxonin Australia. One shows close genetic and morphological similarity with the nearly cosmopolitan Plutella xylostella. The second lineage possesses a similar external morphology, but marked sequence divergence in the barcode region of the cytochrome c oxidase I gene, coupled with clear differences in genitalia. As a consequence, members of this lineage are described as a new species, Plutella australiana Landry {\&} Hebert, which is broadly distributed in the eastern half of Australia.},

We cloned and sequenced a Tri13 homolog from each chemotype. The Tri13 from a NIV chemotype strain (88-1) is located in the trichothecene gene cluster and carries an open reading frame similar to that of Fusarium sporotrichioides, whereas the Tri13 from a DON chemotype strain (H-11) carries several mutations. To confirm the roles of the Tri13 and TK7 genes in trichothecene production by G. zeae, we genetically altered toxin production in 88-1 and H-11. In transgenic strains, the targeted deletion of Tri13 from the genome of 88-1 caused production of DON rather than NIV. Heterologous expression of the 88-1 Tri13 gene alone or in combination with the 88-1 Tri7 gene conferred on H-11 the ability to synthesize NIV; in the latter case, 4-acetylnivalenol (4-ANIV) also was produced. These results suggest that Tri13 and Tri7 are required for oxygenation and acetylation of the oxygen at C-4 during synthesis of NIV and 4-ANIV in G. zeae. These functional analyses of the Tri13 and Tri7 genes provide the first clear evidence for the genetic basis of the DON and NIV chemotypes in G. zeae.},

Ninety-six double haploid lines from a cross between 'CM-82036'and 'Remus' were examined. The lines were tested for DON resistance after application of the toxin in the ear, and for resistances to initial infection and spread of FHB after artificial inoculation with Fusarium spp. Toxin application to flowering ears induced typical FHB symptoms. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses detected one locus with a major effect on DON resistance (logarithm of odds = 53.1, R-2 = 92.6). The DON resistance phenotype was closely associated with an important FHB resistance QTL, Qjhs.ndsu-3BS, which previously was identified as governing resistance to spread of symptoms in the ear. Resistance to the toxin was correlated with resistance to spread of FHB (r = 0.74, P {\textless} 0.001). In resistant wheat lines, the applied toxin was converted to DON-3-O-glucoside as the detoxification product. There was a close relation between the DON-3-glucoside/DON ratio and DON resistance in the toxintreated ears (R-2 = 0.84). We conclude that resistance to DON is important in the FHB resistance complex and hypothesize that Qfhs.ndsu-3BS either encodes a DON-glucosyltransferase or regulates the expression of such an enzyme.},

Drought stress reduces photosynthate production because of stomatal closure. However, this might be partially overcome by an increase in air CO2 concentration. This study was conducted to evaluate elevated CO2 and drought stress effects on grain-filling rate and duration for spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), Spring wheat (cv. Yecora Roja) was grown at two CO2 concentrations, 550 (elevated) or 370 (ambient) pmol mol(-1) and two water treatments in a Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) system at the University of Arizona Maricopa Agricultural Center. Plant samples were collected every 3 to 4 d from 6 d after anthesis until plant maturity. Main stem spikes were separated into upper, middle, and lower sections. Grain weight data for the intact main stem spike, each of its sections, and intact tiller spikes were fitted to a cumulative logistic model. Both elevated CO2 and water treatments significantly influenced the grain-filling processes. Under drought stress conditions, elevated CO2 increased grain weight in the upper and lower sections of the main stem spike by 10 and 24{\%}, respectively. In well-watered plants, final grain weight in the midsection of the main stem spike was 8{\%} higher than that measured under drought stress conditions. Grain weight increase under elevated CO2 was due to a faster rate of grain filling. Effects of elevated CO2 on the statistically derived duration of grain tilling were inconclusive because of the confounding effect of blower-induced temperature changes on the process. An increase in grain weight of well-watered plants was due to a longer grain-tilling period. Later-formed tiller spikes were more responsive to elevated CO2 and drought stress than main stem spikes. Information from this study will help us understand the grain growth of wheat and provide information to establish grain growth mechanism.},

A 24 h interval from heat shock to inoculation allowed the development of maximum resistance. The different cucumber cultivars exhibited distinct induced resistance to C. cucumerinum. Some cultivars exhibited resistance at 40C for 2 h or 45C for an hour, while others had no expression of induced resistance.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric CO2 enrichment may bring different effects on plant growth and evapotranspiration if plants are under N and water deficient conditions. In this study, spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was grown in pots at two atmospheric CO2 concentrations (ambient and elevated), two levels of soil moisture (well-watered and droughted to 45-60{\%} of field capacity) and five nitrogen (N) fertilization treatments (0, 112.5, 225.0, 337.5, 450.0 kg hm(-2)) in growth chambers. Leaf growth, leaf area, and tiller increment were largely a function of N application and water supply. Elevated CO2 increased 23-45{\%} in leaf area only with the N-added treatments 55 days after sowing. Elevated CO2 also reduced stomatal conductance more in droughted treatments (-51{\%}) than in well-watered treatments (-41{\%}), and more with zero N application (-60{\%}) than with the adequate N (-35 to 44{\%}). Evapotranspiration (ET) was also reduced by CO, enrichment in a similar way. Our results showed that the CO2-enrichment-induced decrease in transpiration almost compensated for the increase in ET brought by the higher leaf area under adequate N and water Supply, such that ET was similar for control and CO2-enriched plants. Under reduced N and water supply, CO2 enrichment had limited effect on either leaf growth or ET. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Fusarium head blight (FHB) and crown rot (CR) are two wheat diseases caused by the same Fusarium pathogens. Progress towards CR resistance could benefit from FHB-resistant germplasm if the same genes are involved in resistance to these two different diseases. Two independent studies were conducted to investigate the relationship between host resistances to these two diseases. In the first study 32 genotypes were assessed and no significant correlation between their reactions to FHB and CR was detected. The second study was based on a QTL analysis of a doubled haploid population derived from a variety with resistance to both diseases. Results from this study showed that loci conferring resistance to FHB and CR are located on different chromosomes. Together, these results suggest that, despite a common aetiology, different host genes are involved in the resistance against FHB and CR in wheat. Thus, although it is possible that genes affecting both diseases may exist in other germplasm or under different conditions, separate screening seems to be needed in identifying sources of CR resistance.},

Over recent decades, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense tropical race 4 (Foc-TR4) has seriously threatened worldwide banana plantations. Breeding new resistant cultivars from wild banana species is expected to provide invaluable additional resources. However, knowledge on resistance to Foc-TR4 in wild Musa species is very limited. In this study, eight genotypes of wild banana relatives (Musa acuminata subsp. burmannica, M. balbisiana, M. basjoo, M. itinerans, M. nagensium, M. ruiliensis, M. velutina and M. yunnanensis) were characterized for resistance to Foc-TR4 in both greenhouse and field conditions. Most wild bananas showed higher resistance levels to Foc-TR4 than the reference cultivars {\textquoteleft}Brazilian' (AAA, susceptible) and {\textquoteleft}Goldfinger' (AAAB, moderate resistance). Among the wild species, M. balbisiana showed the highest levels of disease intensity followed by M. acuminata subsp. burmannica. Some individuals of M. yunnanensis, M. nagensium, M. ruiliensis and M. velutina showed low levels of rhizome discolouration in greenhouse conditions, but were resistant in the field. No symptoms were observed on M. basjoo and M. itinerans, suggesting higher levels of resistance to Foc-TR4. The results revealed different sources of resistance to Foc-TR4 in banana wild relatives, which constitute a valuable genetic resource for banana breeding programmes aiming to produce cultivars resistant to fusarium wilt.},

  abstract  = {ABSTRACT One plant genotype displays a resistance phenotype at one development stage but a susceptible reaction to the same pathogen at another stage, which is referred to here as resistance inversion. In wheat, Fusarium head blight (FHB)-resistant cv. Sumai3 showed a Fusarium seedling blight (FSB)-susceptible reaction whereas FHB-susceptible cv. Annong8455 exhibited FSB resistance when challenged with a Fusarium asiaticum strain that produces deoxynivalenol (DON). The resistance to FHB and FSB in wheat was closely associated with expression of a plant cytochrome P450 gene in response to FHB pathogens and mycotoxins. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that expression of nine defense-related genes in spikes and seedlings was induced by the fungal infection, in which a massive accumulation of a plant cytochrome P450 gene, CYP709C1, was clearly associated with the resistance reaction in both seedling and spike. The FHB-resistant Sumai3 accumulated 7-fold more P450 transcripts than did the FHB-susceptible Annong8455, while 84-fold more P450 transcripts were accumulated in the FSB-resistant Annong8455 than the FSB-susceptible Sumai3. A Fusarium strain with a disrupted Tri5 gene, which is not able to produce the first enzyme essential for trichothecene mycotoxin biosynthesis, also induced more P450 transcripts in FHB- and FSB-resistant cultivars. The fungal activation of the P450 gene was more profound in the FSB-resistant reaction than the FHB-resistant reaction relative to their susceptible counterparts. DON triggered a differential expression of the P450 gene with comparable patterns in spikes and seedlings in a resistance-dependent manner. These results may provide a basis for dissecting mechanisms underlying FHB and FSB resistance reactions in wheat and revealing functions of the cytochrome P450 in plant detoxification and defense.},

One technique, soaking 1- to 4-day old seedlings in fungal spore suspension, produced consistent and severe crown rot symptoms. Glasshouse testing of several wheat genotypes using this method produced results that agreed well with previously established field ratings for crown rot disease, suggesting that this assay can be conveniently employed for screening of wheat genotypes for crown rot resistance.},

  abstract  = {Insect pollination, despite its potential to contribute substantially to crop production, is not an integrated part of agronomic planning. A major reason for this are knowledge gaps in the contribution of pollinators to yield, which partly result from difficulties in determining area-based estimates of yield effects from insect pollination under field conditions. We have experimentally manipulated honey bee Apis mellifera densities at 43 oilseed rape Brassica napus fields over 2 years in Scandinavia. Honey bee hives were placed in 22 fields; an additional 21 fields without large apiaries in the surrounding landscape were selected as controls. Depending on the pollination system in the parental generation, the B. napus cultivars in the crop fields are classified as either open-pollinated or first-generation hybrids, with both types being open-pollinated in the generation of plants cultivated in the fields. Three cultivars of each type were grown. We measured the activity of flower-visiting insects during flowering and estimated yields by harvesting with small combine harvesters. The addition of honey bee hives to the fields dramatically increased abundance of flower-visiting honey bees in those fields. Honey bees affected yield, but the effect depended on cultivar type (p = 0.04). Post-hoc analysis revealed that open-pollinated cultivars, but not hybrid cultivars, had 11{\%} higher yields in fields with added honey bees than those grown in the control fields (p = 0.07). To our knowledge, this is the first whole-field study in replicated landscapes to assess the benefit of insect pollination in oilseed rape. Our results demonstrate that honey bees have the potential to increase oilseed rape yields, thereby emphasizing the importance of pollinator management for optimal cultivation of oilseed rape.},

Results showed that the C/N ratio and the amount of soluble fraction in the amended rice straw grown under elevated CO(2) (FR) were 9.8{\%} and 73.1{\%} greater, and the cellulose and lignin were 16.0{\%} and 9.9{\%} lesser than those of the amended rice straw grown under ambient CO(2) (AR), respectively. Compared with those of the AR treatment, the CO(2)-C and CH(4)-C emissions in the FR treatment for 25 d were increased by 7.9{\%} and 25.0{\%}, respectively; a higher ratio of CH(4) to CO(2) emissions induced by straw in the FR treatment was also observed. In contrast, in the treatments with winter wheat straw, the CO(2)-C and CH(4)-C emissions, the ratio of straw-induced CH(4) to CO(2) emissions, and the straw composition were not significantly affected by elevated CO(2), except for an 8.0{\%} decrease in total N and a 9.7{\%} increase in C/N ratio in the wheat straw grown under elevated CO(2). Correlation analysis showed that the net CO(2)-C and CH(4)-C emission from straw and the ratio of straw-induced CH(4) to CO(2) emissions were all exponentially related to the amount of soluble fraction in the amended straw (P {\textless} 0.05). These indicated that under flooded conditions, the turnover and CH(4) emission from crop straw incorporated into soil were dependent on the effect of elevated CO(2) on straw composition, and varied with crop species. Incorporation of rice straw grown under elevated CO(2) would stimulate CH(4) emission from flooded rice fields, whereas winter wheat straw grown under elevated CO(2) had no effect on CH(4) emission.},

  abstract = {Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis (DC.) E.O. Speer f. sp. tritici Em. Marchal (syn. Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici), is one of the major diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. Race-specific resistance has been extensively used in wheat breeding programs, even though it is ephemeral. Adult plant resistance (APR) to powdery mildew is more durable than race-specific resistance. The APR to powdery mildew in winter wheat cultivar Massey has remained effective since its release in 1981. A cross was made between Massey and a powdery mildew susceptible cultivar Becker. Powdery mildew severity on F-2 leaves (the second leaf below the flag leaf) of 180 F2:3 lines was rated under natural disease pressure in the field. Among 213 RFLP and 139 microsatellite markers surveyed, 88 (41{\%}) and 90 (65{\%}) markers, respectively, detected polymorphism between Becker and Massey. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) was used to facilitate the identification of molecular markers associated with APR to powdery mildew. Three quantitative trait loci (QTLs), designated as QPm.vt-1B, QPm.vt-2A, and QPm.vt-2B, were identified with interval mapping. They are located on wheat chromosomes 1B, 2A, and 2B, and, respectively, explained 17, 29, and 11{\%} of the total variation of F2:3 lines for powdery mildew resistance. The three QTLs associated with APR to powdery mildew were derived from Massey, and displayed additive gene action. QPm.vt-2B also fits a recessive model for APR to powdery mildew. In a multi-QTL model, the three QTLs explained 50{\%} of the total variation of F2:3 lines for APR to powdery mildew. The presence of the three QTLs was confirmed with 97 recombinant inbred (RI) lines, tested for APR to powdery mildew under natural powdery mildew pressure over 3 yr (F5:6--F7:8 generation). The molecular markers identified in this study have potential for use in marker-assisted selection and pyramiding of genes for resistance to powdery mildew.},

  abstract = {Fusarium crown rot (FCR) is a major disease of wheat and barley, and stem-base browning has been routinely used to measure resistance. Compared with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) shows less severe FCR stem-base browning symptoms (indicative of greater resistance or tolerance) but suffers higher yield loss (indicative of greater susceptibility), whereas durum wheat (T. durum Desf.) shows similar FCR severity but suffers much worse yield loss. To understand these differences, fungal biomass in bread and durum wheats and barley was estimated by real-time quantitative PCR at different stages of FCR disease development. Similar to a previous report on bread wheat infection by Fusarium graminearum, FCR infection caused by Fusarium pseudograminearum also showed three distinct phases in each of the three crop species analysed. During all stages of FCR disease development, barley varieties invariably displayed earlier and faster fungal accumulation compared with either bread or durum wheat. Although suffering much greater yield loss than barley, durum wheat appears to accumulate significantly lower levels of F. pseodugraminearum during infection. These results demonstrate that bread wheat varieties are more resistant to FCR infection and pathogen accumulation than barley varieties, and the less yield loss of the latter is likely due to its better tolerance to this disease. If also existing among different sources of resistance within a given species, these different features of disease resistance and tolerance could be exploited to minimize yield loss of new varieties.},

Results indicate South Asia and Southern Africa as two regions that, without sufficient adaptation measures, will likely suffer negative impacts on several crops that are important to large food-insecure human populations. We also find that uncertainties vary widely by crop, and therefore priorities will depend on the risk attitudes of investment institutions.},

  abstract = {Climate change will include correlated increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration (C(a)). Rising temperatures will increase the ratio of photorespiratory loss of carbon to photosynthetic gain, whilst rising C(a) will have an opposing effect. The mechanism of these effects at the level of carboxylation in C3 photosynthesis are quantitatively well understood and provide a basis for models of the response of leaf and canopy carbon exchange to climate change. The principles of such a model are referred to here and used to quantitatively examine the implications of concurrent increase in temperature and C(a). Simulations of leaf photosynthesis show the increase, with elevation of C(a) from 350 to 650-mu-mol mol-1, in light saturated rates of CO2 uptake (A(sat)) and maximum quantum yields (phi) to rise with temperature. An increase in C(a) from 350 to 650-mu-mol mol-1 can increase A(sat) by 20{\%} at 10-degrees-C and by 105{\%} at 35-degrees-C, and can raise the temperature optimum of A(sat) by 5-degrees-C. This pattern of change agrees closely with experimental data. At the canopy level, simulations also suggest a strong interaction of increased temperature and CO2 concentration. Predictions are compared with the findings of long-term field studies. The principles used here suggest that elevated C(a) will alter both the magnitude of the response of leaf and canopy carbon gain to rising temperature, and sometimes, the direction of response. Findings question the value of models for predicting plant production in response to climate change which ignore the direct effects of rising C(a) and the modifications that rising C(a) imposes on the temperature response of net CO2 exchange.},

Conidial viability in pellets decreased by 50{\%} after an average of 15.1 and 9.1days at 25 and 40 degrees C, respectively, when packaged in polypropylene bags. Active packaging (hermetic bag+O-2/moisture-absorbing sachet) increased the shelf lives almost 10 and 6 times at 25 and 40 degrees C, respectively.

Pellets with pheromone and conidia were as attractive to C.sordidus as banana rhizomes, and considerably more attractive than pieces of pseudostem.

Also, a large proportion of the harvested grain can be spoiled when the colonizing Fusarium mycelia produce trichothecene mycotoxins, such as deoxynivalenol (DON). In this study, we have explored the intracellular polar metabolome of Fusarium spp. in both toxin-producing and nonproducing conditions in vitro. Four Fusarium spp., including nine well-characterized wild-type field isolates now used routinely in laboratory experimentation, were explored. A metabolic ?triple-fingerprint? was recorded using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance and direct-injection electrospray ionization?mass spectroscopy in both positive- and negative-ionization modes. These combined metabolomic analyses revealed that this technique is sufficient to resolve different wild-type isolates and different growth conditions. Principal components analysis was able to resolve the four species explored?F. graminearum, F. culmorum, F. pseudograminearum, and F. venenatum?as well as individual isolate differences from the same species. The external nutritional environment was found to have a far greater influence on the metabolome than the genotype of the organism. Conserved responses to DON-inducing medium were evident and included increased abundance of key compatible solutes, such as glycerol and mannitol. In addition, the concentration of ?-aminobutyric acid was elevated, indicating that the cellular nitrogen status may be affected by growth on DON-inducing medium.},

  abstract = {Pests and diseases impact on crop yield and quality, and also reduce resource-use efficiency. Improved crop protection strategies to prevent such damage and loss can increase production and make a substantial contribution to food security. DNA-based technologies are likely to greatly increase the speed, sensitivity and accuracy of pest and pathogen detection and diagnosis. Rapid sequencing of nucleic acids from infected plants will aid identification of novel disease agents. Biomarkers of disease or crop damage such as volatile chemicals or blends may also be used to detect pest outbreaks. Biosensors coupled to information networks will provide real-time monitoring and surveillance of crops or stored produce and hence early warning of emerging problems and new invasive species. Challenges remain in the dissemination of new technologies and information to resource poor farmers in developing countries, although the rapid extension of the internet, mobile phones and other communication networks will provide new opportunities. Defining the genetic and molecular basis of innate plant immunity has been a major advance in plant biology with the potential to identify new targets for intervention via novel chemistry or genetic modification (GM). Identification of regulatory genes, signal molecules, pathways and networks controlling induced plant defence should lead to the development of a new generation of defence modulators, delivered either as crop protection products, or via biological agents on seeds or in the root zone. There should also be opportunities to select more responsive crop genotypes, or to develop transgenic crops tailored to respond to specific chemical cues or molecular patterns diagnostic for particular biotic threats. Sequencing of the genomes of the major crop species and their wild relatives will expand enormously the known gene pool and diversity of genetic resources available for plant breeders to access. It should be possible to identify genomic regions and genes conferring more durable, quantitative resistance to pathogens. The breeding cycle will be accelerated by high-throughput phenotyping and more efficient selection of resistance traits using within-gene markers. GM approaches will facilitate pyramiding (combining) resistance genes with different specificities and modes of action, thereby reducing the risk of directional selection for virulence. Analysis of the genomes of plant pathogens and invertebrate pests is already providing new information on genes, gene families and processes involved in host colonization and pathogenicity. Comparative genomics of species with diverse host ranges, contrasting feeding habits and different pathogenic lifestyles will identify new targets for inhibiting pest attack and aid the development of novel antimicrobial drugs and pesticides. Understanding the natural ecology of pests and pathogens, such as the factors determining host location, resource exploitation and interactions with other organisms, will improve our ability to manipulate behaviour, or exploit natural enemies or other antagonists of pest species. Volatile signals, either from natural plant sources, or engineered in transgenic crops, will be more widely used to modify pest behaviour. It may also be possible to manipulate microbial communities regulating pathogen populations and activity, and thereby recruit and retain more effective biocontrol agents. Insights into the natural diversity and activity of soil and microbial populations in the zones surrounding roots and seeds will provide new information on mechanism of suppression regulating pest species. Fully effective interventions are unlikely, due to the complexity and diversity of the soil system, but there should be progress towards integrated control regimes combining more resistant crop genotypes (either selected or GM) with targeted management of natural suppressive processes. Harnessing new technologies and knowledge to create more durable resistant crops and sustainable disease and pest management systems will require improved understanding of the factors driving pest and pathogen adaptation and evolution. There must also be an increased emphasis on translational research and delivery, and developing strategies appropriate for lower-input production systems, if the second 'green revolution' is to become a reality.},

Overall, climate change is predicted to have a progressively negative effect on the yield of food crops, particularly in the absence of efforts to mitigate global CO2 emissions. As with all species, plant pathogens will have varying responses to climate change. Whilst the life cycle of some pathogens will be limited by increasing temperatures, e.g. Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici, other climatic factors such as increasing atmospheric CO2, may provide more favourable conditions for pathogens such as Fusarium pseudograminearum. Based on published literature and unpublished work in progress, we have reviewed the qualitative effects of climate change on pathogens that cause disease of four major food crops: wheat, rice, soybean and potato. The limited data show that the influence will be positive, negative or neutral, depending on the host--pathogen interaction. Quantitative analysis of climate change on pathogens of these crops is largely lacking, either from field or laboratory studies or from modelling-based assessments. Systematic quantitative analysis of these effects will be necessary in developing future disease management plans, such as plant breeding, altered planting schedules, chemical and biological control methods and increased monitoring for new disease threats.},

In addition to the future size of the population, its distribution by age, sex, level of educational attainment and place of residence are of specific importance for studying future food security.

  abstract = {An experiment was conducted to study the effects of free-air CO2 enrichment on the growth and N uptake of winter wheat. The treatments comprised: CO2 at elevated and ambient conditions; and N at 150 and 250 kg/ha. The increase in wheat biomass averaged between 28.3 and 44.5{\%}, where the response was significant and highest at jointing stage. Under low and high N conditions, the biomass for leaves, shoots, ears and roots increased significantly by 36.8 and 40.9{\%}, 91.2 and 53.2{\%}, 89.4 and 52.2{\%}, and 55.5 and 67.9{\%}, respectively. N content in wheat decreased by 3.6-25.3{\%}, on average, due to elevated CO2 at both N levels and decreased more at low than at high N conditions. On the other hand, N uptake significantly increased by 20.8 and 29.2{\%} at low and high N, respectively, at jointing stage and by 1.6-32.4{\%} at other growth stages. Under elevated CO2 conditions, the relative absorption rate was 37.6{\%} at high N conditions, while the opposite was observed under ambient conditions at jointing stage.},

  abstract = {Crown rot (CR), caused by various Fusarium species, is a chronic wheat disease in Australia. As part of our objective of improving the efficiency of breeding CR resistant wheat varieties, we have been searching for novel sources of resistance. This paper reports on the genetic control of one of these newly identified resistant genotypes, 'CSCR6'. A population derived from a cross between CSCR6 and an Australian variety 'Lang' was analyzed using two Fusarium isolates belonging to two different species, one Fusarium pseudograminearum and the other Fusarium graminearum. The two isolates detected QTL with the same chromosomal locations and comparable magnitudes, indicating that CR resistance is not species-specific. The resistant allele of one of the QTL was derived from 'CSCR6'. This QTL, designated as Qcrs.cpi-3B, was located on the long arm of chromosome 3B and explains up to 48.8{\%} of the phenotypic variance based on interval mapping analysis. Another QTL, with resistant allele from the variety 'Lang', was located on chromosome 4B. This QTL explained up to 22.8{\%} of the phenotypic variance. A strong interaction between Qcsr.cpi-3B and Qcsr.cpi-4B was detected, reducing the maximum effect of Qcrs.cpi-3B to 43.1{\%}. The effects of Qcrs.cpi-3B were further validated in four additional populations and the presence of this single QTL reduced CR severity by up to 42.1{\%}. The fact that significant effects of Qcrs.cpi-3B were detected across all trials with different genetic backgrounds and with the use of isolates belonging to two different Fusarium species make it an ideal target for breeding programs as well as for further characterization of the gene(s) involved in its resistance.},

  abstract = {Climate change will affect both growth of agricultural crops and diseases that attack them but there has been little work to study how its impacts on crop growth influence impacts on disease epidemics. This paper investigates how impacts of climate change on wheat anthesis date will influence impacts on fusarium ear blight in UK mainland arable areas. A wheat growth model was used for projections of anthesis dates, and a weather-based model was developed for use in projections of incidence of fusarium ear blight in the UK. Daily weather data, generated for 14 sites in arable areas of the UK for a baseline (1960-1990) scenario and for high and low CO(2) emissions in the 2020s and 2050s, were used to project wheat anthesis dates and fusarium ear blight incidence for each site for each climate change scenario. Incidence of fusarium ear blight was related to rainfall during anthesis and temperature during the preceding 6 weeks. It was projected that, with climate change, wheat anthesis dates will be earlier and fusarium ear blight epidemics will be more severe, especially in southern England, by the 2050s. These projections, made by combining crop and disease models for different climate change scenarios, suggest that improved control of fusarium ear blight should be a high priority in industry and government strategies for adaptation to climate change to ensure food security.},

In both years the total fungal populations (cm(2) leaf) were found to have increased due to exposure to either elevated CO2 and elevated CO2 + temperature treatments. This was mainly due to significant increases in populations of Cladosporium spp. (C. cladosporioides and C. herbarum) on the flag leaves during ripening. Other phyllosphere component species such as white and pink yeasts were not markedly affected by treatments. The range of fungal species found in such controlled environment chambers was narrower than that commonly found on nag leaves of field grown crops. Common and important colonisers of leaves and ripening ears such as Aureobasidium pullulans, Epicoccum nigrum and Fusarium spp. were seldom isolated.},

It considers the effect of changes in temperature/water availability on mycotoxin contamination, especially incidences where aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A production has been influenced. The potential of using preharvest models to predict risk from deoxynivalenol (DON) in wheat, fumonisin B1 in maize and aflatoxins in maize and peanuts in different continents are considered in the context of potential for adaptation to include climate-change scenarios. Available information suggests that slightly elevated CO2 concentrations and interactions with temperature and water availability may stimulate growth of some mycotoxigenic species, especially under water stress. The accumulated knowledge on interacting conditions of water/temperature effects on optimum and boundary conditions for growth and mycotoxin production has been used to predict the effects that +3 and +5{$^{\circ}$}C increases under water stress would have on growth/mycotoxin production by mycotoxigenic species. Various spatial scales, from toxin gene expression to regional approaches using geostatistics, are examined for their use in understanding the impact that climate change may have on food contamination in developing and developed countries. The potential for using an integrated systems approach to link gene expression data, phenotypic toxin production under different interacting abiotic conditions is discussed using Fusarium species and DON as examples. Such approaches may be beneficial for more accurate predictions of risk from mycotoxins on a regional basis and also the potential for new emerging toxin threats.},

  abstract = {The present investigation was carried out in a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) facility to assess the effect of elevated CO2 on the incidence and severity of three foliar diseases of Brassica juncea cv. Pusa Tarak. Exposure of plants to elevated concentration of CO2 (550 ppm) revealed lower incidence and severity of Alternaria blight caused by Alternaria brassicae and downy mildew caused by Hyaloperonospora brassicae, while white rust infection caused by Albugo candida increased. Leaves of mustard plants grown under elevated CO2 had a higher amount of epicuticular wax which, together with higher concentration of total phenols and phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity, may have increased the ability of mustard plants to resist infection by A. brassicae and H. brassicae. Mustard plants grown under elevated CO2 showed a decrease in stomatal density and pore size, and consequently also in stomatal conductance. This might explain the decrease in disease index of downy mildew caused by the stomata-invading pathogen H. brassicae. There was no change in leaf protein concentration, whereas sugars were three times as concentrated in plants grown under high vs. ambient CO2. There was an increase in the concentration of total glucosinolates (GSs) under FACE in plants grown under elevated CO2, but a decrease in their diversity. Namely, the aliphatic GS gluconapin was more abundant in plants grown under high CO2, while three out of eight different GSs found in the leaves of plants grown under ambient CO2 could not be detected. Higher sugar availability and lower GSs diversity may account for the higher incidence and severity of white rust caused by the obligate biotroph A. candida.},

  abstract = {The effect of elevated CO2 concentrations on the levels of secondary metabolites was investigated in tobacco plants grown under two nitrogen supply (5 and 8 mm NH4NO3) and CO2 conditions (350 and 1000 p.p.m.) each. High CO2 resulted in a dramatic increase of phenylpropanoids in the leaves, including the major carbon-rich compound chlorogenic acid (CGA) and the coumarins scopolin and scopoletin at both nitrogen fertilizations. This was accompanied by increased PAL activity in leaves and roots, which was even higher at the lower nitrogen supply. Hardly any change was observed for the structural phenolic polymer lignin and the sesquiterpenoid capsidiol. In contrast, elevated CO2 led to clearly decreased levels of the main nitrogen-rich constituent nicotine at the lower N-supply (5 mm NH4NO3) but not when plants were grown at the higher N-supply (8 mm NH4NO3). Inoculation experiments with potato virus Y (PVY) were used to evaluate possible ecological consequences of elevated CO2. The titre of viral coat-protein was markedly reduced in leaves under these conditions at both nitrogen levels. Since PR-gene expression and free salicylic acid (SA) levels remained unchanged at elevated CO2, we suggest that the accumulation of phenylpropanoids, for example, the major compound CGA and the coumarins scopolin and scopoletin may result in an earlier confinement of the virus at high CO2. Based on our results two final conclusions emerge. First, elevated CO2 leads to a shift in secondary metabolite composition that is dependent on the availability of nitrogen. Second, changes in the pool of secondary metabolites have important consequences for plant-pathogen interactions as shown for PVY as a test organism.},

  abstract = {Contributions to historical climate change have varied substantially among nations. These differences reflect underlying inequalities in wealth and development, and pose a fundamental challenge to the implementation of a globally equitable climate mitigation strategy. This Letter presents a new way to quantify historical inequalities among nations using carbon and climate debts, defined as the amount by which national climate contributions have exceeded a hypothetical equal per-capita share over time. Considering only national CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, accumulated carbon debts across all nations from 1990 to 2013 total 250 billion tonnes of CO2, representing 40{\%} of cumulative world emissions since 1990. Expanding this to reflect the temperature response to a range of emissions, historical climate debts accrued between 1990 and 2010 total 0.11 {$^{\circ}$}C, close to a third of observed warming over that period. Large fractions of this debt are carried by industrialized countries, but also by countries with high levels of deforestation and agriculture. These calculations could contribute to discussions of climate responsibility by providing a tangible way to quantify historical inequalities, which could then inform the funding of mitigation, adaptation and the costs of loss and damages in those countries that have contributed less to historical warming.},

With few exceptions, abscisic acid has been considered a negative regulator of disease resistance. This negative effect appears to be due to the interference of abscisic acid with biotic stress signaling that is regulated by salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene, and to an additional effect of ABA on shared components of stress signaling. However, recent research shows that abscisic acid can also be implicated in increasing the resistance of plants towards pathogens via its positive effect on callose deposition.},

  abstract = {Growing concern over the potentially devastating impacts of climate change on biodiversity and food security, considered together with the growing world population, means that taking action to conserve crop wild relative (CWR) diversity is no longer an option-it is an urgent priority. Crop wild relatives are species closely related to crops, including their progenitors, which have the potential to contribute beneficial traits for crop improvement, such as biotic and abiotic resistances, leading to improved yield and stability. Having already made major contributions to crop improvement in the 20\textsuperscript{th} century, CWR are recognized as acritical resource to sustain global food security; therefore, their systematic conservation is imperative. However, extending their conservation and promoting more systematic exploitation is hindered by a lack of understanding of their current and potential value, their diversity, and practically how they might be conserved. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to (i) demonstrate the current and potential use of CWR in crop improvement, (ii) estimate how many CWR species exist and how many are a global priority for active conservation, and (iii) describe how a global network for the in situ conservation of CWR might be established that could help to underpin future food security.},

  abstract = {Rhizoctonia oryzae and R. solani anastomosis group (AG)-8 both cause root rot of wheat and barley, but R. oryzae has been considered secondary in importance to R. solani AG-8 on these cereals in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Of 19 isolates of R. oryzae, 12 caused both preemergence damping-off of wheat and a significant reduction in root biomass of 21-day-old seedlings in natural soil at 12 degrees C, whereas 7 isolates induced minimal or no damage to wheat under these growth conditions. R. solani AG-8 had no effect on seedling emergence and seminal root development, but four of eight isolates tested caused severe root rot of wheat. Thus, R. oryzae and R. solani AG-8 may cause distinctive and different damage as pathogens of wheat, and their relative importance may vary among field sites and with the developmental stage of the host plant. The nucleotide sequence of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions was divergent between the two species; therefore, the oligonucleotide primers RO1 and RO2 were developed from sequences within ITS1 and ITS2, respectively, that are unique to R. oryzae. These primers amplified a 511-bp fragment from DNA of R. oryzae but not DNA from any intraspecific group of R. solani or from binucleate Rhizoctonia spp. A polymerase chain reaction protocol with the RO1 and RO2 primer set was used to detect R. oryzae in wheat roots and is a suitable method to diagnose this fungus.},

Pathotype surveys for Phytophthora sojae are conducted to monitor resistance gene efficacy and determine if new resistance genes are needed. Valuable measurements for pathotype analysis include the distribution of susceptible reactions, pathotype complexity, pathotype frequency, and diversity indices for pathotype distributions. Previously the Habgood-Gilmour Spreadsheet (HaGiS), written in Microsoft Excel, was used for data analysis. However, the growing popularity of the R programming language in plant pathology and desire for reproducible research made HaGiS a prime candidate for conversion into an R package. Here we report on the development and use of an R package, hagis, that can be used to produce all outputs from the HaGiS Excel sheet for P. sojae or other gene-for-gene pathosystem studies.},

Pathogen populations with a high evolutionary potential are more likely to overcome genetic resistance than pathogen populations with a low evolutionary potential. We propose a flexible framework to predict the evolutionary potential of pathogen populations based on analysis of their genetic structure. According to this framework, pathogens that pose the greatest risk of breaking down resistance genes have a mixed reproduction system, a high potential for genotype flow, large effective population sizes, and high mutation rates. The lowest risk pathogens are those with strict asexual reproduction, low potential for gene flow, small effective population sizes, and low mutation rates. We present examples of high-risk and low-risk pathogens. We propose general guidelines for a rational approach to breed durable resistance according to the evolutionary potential of the pathogen.},

In this study conducted over five years, we assessed how elevated CO2 and interannual climatic variability affect Cercospora leaf spot diseases of two deciduous trees. Climatic data varied considerably between the five years and altered disease expression. Disease incidence and severity for both species were greater in years with above average rainfall. in years with above average temperatures, disease incidence for Liquidambar styraciflua was decreased significantly. When significant changes did occur, disease incidence and severity always increased under elevated CO2. Chlorophyll fluorescence imaging of leaves revealed that any visible increase in disease severity induced by elevated CO2 was mitigated by higher photosynthetic efficiency in the remaining undamaged leaf tissue and in a halo surrounding lesions.

  abstract  = {Climate change (CC) scenarios are predicted to have significant effects on the security of staple commodities. A key component of this impact is the infection of such crops by mycotoxigenic moulds and contamination with mycotoxins. The impacts of CC on mycotoxigenic fungi requires examination of the impacts of the three-way interactions between elevated CO2(350--400 vs 650--1200 ppm), temperature increases (+2--5 {$^{\circ}$}C) and drought stress on growth/mycotoxin production by key spoilage fungi in cereals and nuts. This review examines the available evidence on the impacts of interacting CC factors on growth and mycotoxin production by key mycotoxigenic fungi including Alternaria, Aspergillus, Fusarium and Penicillium species. Aspergillus flavus responsible for producing aflatoxin B1(AFB1) is a class 1A carcinogen and its growth appears to be unaffected by CC factors. However, there is a significant stimulation of AFB1production both in vitro and in vivo in maize. In contrast, studies on Aspergillus section Circumdati and Nigri species responsible for ochratoxin A contamination of a range of commodities and F. verticillioides and fumonisins suggest that some species are more resilient than others, especially in terms of mycotoxin production. Acclimatisation of mycotoxigenic fungal pathogens to CC factors may result in increased disease and perhaps mycotoxin contamination of staple cereals. Predictive modelling approaches to help identify regions where maximum impact may occur in terms of infection by mycotoxigenic fungi and toxin contamination of staple crops is hindered by the lack of reliable inputs on effects of the interacting CC factors. The present available knowledge is discussed in the context of the resilience of staple food chains and the impact that interacting CC factors may have on the availability of food in the future.},

Entomopathogenic fungi, specifically the anamorphic taxa Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae, Hypocreales (Ascomycota), are among the natural enemies of pests in agroecosystems and the fungi are candidates for future conservation biological control in temperate regions. Conservation biological control is a biological control strategy in which farming practices and environmental manipulations are adopted to enhance the living conditions for specific natural enemies of pests. However, in order to manipulate the environment for the benefit of populations of the entomopathogens, knowledge of fundamental aspects of the ecology of the fungi considered is necessary. This knowledge is still scarce despite the large bulk of recent research into inoculation and inundation biological control with these fungi. Here, we review the current knowledge of the ecology of indigenous populations of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae in agroecosystems of temperate regions, primarily Europe and North America. We suggest anamorphic life cycles of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae in these regions based on the literature of their natural occurrence and distribution in agroecosystems, population dynamics, and interactions with other organisms, environmental factors, and agronomical practices.},

No significant increase in net CO2 assimilation rate was observed in barley grown under elevated [CO2] at ambient temperature. However, this rate was positively stimulated under elevated temperature together with a slightly higher potential quantum efficiency of PSII, both at ambient and elevated [CO2], suggesting that photosynthesis was not limited by [CO2] at ambient temperature. When growing under elevated temperature or [O3], infection by the biotrophic powdery mildew fungus decreased, whereas disease symptoms and growth of the toxin-secreting hemibiotrophic spot blotch fungus increased compared to ambient conditions, implying that climate-induced changes in disease severity could be linked to the trophic lifestyle of the pathogens. Elevated [CO2] decreased powdery mildew infection but had no effect on spot blotch disease compared to ambient condition. However, the effect of elevated [CO2], [O3] and temperature did not act in an additive manner when combined. This led to a surprising disease development in the combination treatments, where powdery mildew infection increased despite the individual reducing effect of the climatic factors, and spot blotch disease decreased despite the individual promoting effect of temperature and ozone, emphasizing the importance of conducting multifactorial experiments when evaluating the potential effects of climate change.},

Plant disease diagnostic networks have developed worldwide to address the problems of efficient and effective disease diagnosis and pathogen detection, engendering cooperation of institutions and experts within countries and across national borders. Networking maximizes impact in the face of shrinking government investments in agriculture and diminishing human resource capacity in diagnostics and applied pathology.

of the melanised root-associated fungi did not reduce plant growth. Twenty-four isolates tended to increase plant growth and were tentatively identified as predominantly ascomycetes, and one zygomycete. Melanised root-associated fungi appeared to form complex interactions with T. subterraneum, the natures of which remain to be further explored. Melanised root-associated fungi could potentially play key ecological roles including positively influencing edaphic conditions.},

growth and architecture with disease under ambient and elevated CO2. A level of induced resistance in plants with enlarged canopy determined anthracnose severity at elevated CO2. Moisture-related microclimatic variables determined infection at ambient but not at elevated CO2. At high CO2 increased disease level from raised pathogen fecundity in enlarged canopy accelerated pathogen evolution after 25 sequential infection cycles. Modelling of pathogen dynamics under climate change currently suffers from a paucity of quantitative data, mismatch of scales in coupling climate and disease models, and model uncertainties. Further experimental research on interactions of biotic and abiotic factors on plant diseases under climate change and validation of models are essential prior to their use in climate-change prediction. Understanding and anticipating trends in host--pathogen evolution under climate change will improve the durability of resistance and lay the foundation for increased crop adaptation through pre-emptive plant breeding.},

  abstract = {Climate change influences on pests and pathogens are mainly plant-mediated. Rising carbon dioxide and temperature and altered precipitation modifies plant growth and development with concomitant changes in canopy architecture, size, density, microclimate and the quantity of susceptible tissue. The modified host physiology and canopy microclimate at elevated carbon dioxide influences production, dispersal and survival of pathogen inoculum and feeding behaviour of insect pests. Elevated temperature accelerates plant growth and developmental rates to modify canopy architecture and pest and pathogen development. Altered precipitation affects canopy architecture through either drought or flooding stress with corresponding effects on pests and pathogens. But canopy-level interactions are largely ignored in epidemiology models used to project climate change impacts. Nevertheless, models based on rules of plant morphogenesis have been used to explore pest and pathogen dynamics and their trophic interactions under elevated carbon dioxide. The prospect of modifying canopy architecture for pest and disease management has also been raised. We offer a conceptual framework incorporating canopy characteristics in the traditional disease triangle concept to advance understanding of host-pathogen-environment interactions and explore how climate change may influence these interactions. From a review of recent literature we summarize interrelationships between canopy architecture of cultivated crops, pest and pathogen biology and climate change under four areas of research: (a) relationships between canopy architecture, microclimate and host-pathogen interaction; (b) effect of climate change related variables on canopy architecture; (c) development of pests and pathogens in modified canopy under climate change; and (d) pests and pathogen management under climate change.},

  volume   = {29},
  abstract = {In Northern Europe, changes in climate may result in better growing conditions for many crops. However, the expected warmer and more humid conditions are favourable for Fusarium head blight infections on cereals. The Fusarium species prevalent in Nordic areas to date are the same as in Central Europe: F. avenaceum, F. culmorum, F. graminearum and F. poae. The prevalence of F. graminearum in cereal grain has already increased in Central Europe and is likely to increase in the North due to the expected changes in weather conditions, reduced tillage and the predicted increase in maize cultivation in Nordic countries. The possible weather extremes predispose cereals to Fusarium infections by increasing the populations of insect pests injuring plants. Adverse conditions may even create conditions suitable for F. subglutinans or F. verticilloides to infect maize and possibly other cereals in rotation in southern parts of Scandinavia. The importance of the species that infect in relatively dry conditions, F. langsethiae and F. poae, may also increase on winter cereals which are predicted to be more prevalent in future farming. If the number of crop species cultivated will increase and non-cereal crops are included in rotations effects of reduced tillage on Fusarium infections in grain could be limited. The predicted changes in climate towards 2050 are expected to slightly change Fusarium species composition in Northern Europe. An increase in F. graminearum and possibly the invasion of northern parts of Central Europe and Denmark by fumonisin producers is expected.},

We show how epidemiological insights about the dynamics of disease spread can improve the targeting of when and where to sample. We outline some relatively simple but powerful statistical approaches to inform surveillance and describe how they can be adapted to include epidemiological information. This enables us to address questions such as: Following the first report of an invading pathogen, what is the likely incidence of disease? If no cases of disease have been found, how certain can we be that the disease was not simply missed by chance? We il-lustrate the use of spatially explicit stochastic models to optimize targeting of surveillance and control resources. Finally, we discuss how modern detection and diagnostic technologies as well as information from passive surveillance networks (e.g., citizen science) can be integrated into surveillance strategies. 591},

  abstract = {This article reviews and analyzes the literature on Yellow dwarf viruses (YDVs) in Australia, examining the range of environmental and climatic factors that explain the observed geographical distribution of the virus and its vectors. BYDV-PAV, vectored mainly by the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi, is the most prevalent YDV species in wheat and grasslands across all states, except Queensland. BYDV-RMV, vectored mainly by Rhopalosiphum maidis, dominates in Queensland grasslands, with very low incidence in wheat. Queensland experiences higher rainfall and warmer temperatures than southern Australia. Across Australia disease incidence in wheat is generally low (around 10 {\%}) and varies from year to year, with the highest incidence found on occasion in Western Australia (up to 52 {\%}) and the lowest in Queensland ({\textless} 1 {\%}). Across Australia there is a much higher virus incidence and more variation in YDV species present in grasslands than in wheat, although in general BYDV-PAV still dominates. An overview of the differences between the YDV species in terms of symptoms, impacts, frequency, transmission rates and geographical distribution is necessary to appreciate the implications of virus spread across Australia, as well as the risks from the interaction of YDV with more recently introduced wheat pathogens. This overview is set in the context of a changing climate, with a discussion of the possible implications of anthropogenic climate change for future epidemics. For example, increasing temperatures in the future may result in more rapid transmission of the virus in the cooler months than at present, with implications for winter crops such as wheat, where YDV currently does most damage. Also, there is potential for the spread of BYDV-RMV further south, as changes in climatic conditions alter both the transmission potential of the virus as well as the vectoring potential by the aphids R. padi and R. maidis. Finally, critical knowledge gaps are identified, highlighting a need for ongoing seasonal monitoring of the virus and vectors to support the use of simulation models to predict the incidence of YDVs in near real-time.},

  abstract = {This invited review and opinion piece, assesses the impact of climate change on mycotoxins in food: only one paper and an abstract referred directly from a substantial literature search and then only in relation to Europe. Climate change is an accepted probability by most scientists. Favourable temperature and water activity are crucial for mycotoxigenic fungi and mycotoxin production. Fungal diseases of crops provide relevant information for pre-harvest mycotoxin contamination. However, the mycotoxin issue also involves post-harvest scenarios. There are no data on how mycotoxins affect competing organisms in crop ecosystems. In general, if the temperature increases in cool or temperate climates, the relevant countries may become more liable to aflatoxins. Tropical countries may become too inhospitable for conventional fungal growth and mycotoxin production. Could this lead to the extinction of thermotolerant Aspergillus flavus? Currently cold regions may become liable to temperate problems concerning ochratoxin A, patulin and Fusarium toxins (e.g. deoxynivalenol). Regions which can afford to control the environment of storage facilities may be able to avoid post-harvest problems but at high additional cost. There appears to be a lack of awareness of the issue in some non-European countries. The era will provide numerous challenges for mycotoxicologists. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

A quantitative review of tebuconazole effect on Fusarium head blight and deoxynivalenol content in wheat. Phytopathology 97:211-220. A meta-analysis of the effect of tebuconazole (e.g., Folicur 3.6F) on Fusarium head blight and deoxynivalenol (DON) content of wheat grain was performed using data collected from uniform fungicide trials (UFTs) conducted at multiple locations across U.S. wheat-growing regions. Response ratios (mean disease and DON levels from tebuconazole-treated plots, divided by mean disease and DON levels from untreated check plots) were calculated for each of 139 studies for tebuconazole effect on Fusarium head blight index (IND; field or plot-level disease severity, i.e., mean proportion of diseased spikelets per spike) and 101 studies for tebuconazole effect on DON contamination of harvested grain. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed on the log-transformed ratios, and the estimated mean log ratios were transformed to estimate the mean (expected) percent control for IND (IND C) and DON (DON C). A mixed-effects meta-analysis was then done to determine the effects of wheat type (spring versus winter wheat) and disease and DON levels in the controls on the log ratios. Tebuconazole was more effective at limiting IND than DON, with IND C and DON C values of 40.3 and 21.6{\%}, respectively. The efficacy of tebuconazole as determined by the impact on both IND and DON was greater in spring wheat than in winter wheat (P {\textless} 0.01), with a 13.2{\%} higher IND C and a 12.4{\%} higher DON C in spring wheat than in winter wheat. In general, IND C and DON C were both at their lowest values (and not significantly different from 0) when mean IND and DON in the controls, respectively, were low ($\leq$2{\%} for IND and {\textless}1 ppm for DON). IND C was 25{\%} higher in studies with mean IND between 2 and 15{\%} than in studies with mean IND $\leq$ 2{\%}, whereas DON C was 28.8{\%} higher in studies with mean DON between 1 and 10 ppm than in studies with mean DON {\textless} 1 ppm. The between-study variance was significantly greater than 0 (P {\textless} 0.01), indicating considerable (unexplained) variability in percent control.},

A multivariate random-effects meta-analytical model was fitted to the log-transformed treatment means from over 100 uniform fungicide studies across 11 years and 14 states, and the mean log ratio (relative to the untreated check or tebuconazole mean) was determined as the overall effect size for quantifying fungicide efficacy. Mean log ratios were then transformed to estimate mean percent reduction in IND and DON relative to the untreated check (percent control: C(IND) and C(DON)) and relative to tebuconazole. All fungicides led to a significant reduction in IND and DON (P {\textless} 0.001), although there was substantial between-study variability. Prothioconazole+tebuconazole was the most effective fungicide for IND, with a C(IND) of 52{\%}, followed by metconazole (50{\%}), prothioconazole (48{\%}), tebuconazole (40{\%}), and propiconazole (32{\%}). For DON, metconazole was the most effective treatment, with a [Formula: see text](DON) of 45{\%}; prothioconazole+tebuconazole and prothioconazole showed similar efficacy, with C(DON) values of 42 and 43{\%}, respectively; tebuconazole and propiconazole were the least effective, with C(DON) values of 23 and 12{\%}, respectively. All fungicides, with the exception of propiconazole, were significantly more effective than tebuconazole for control of both IND and DON (P {\textless} 0.001). Relative to tebuconazole, prothioconazole, metconazole, and tebuconzole+prothioconzole reduced disease index a further 14 to 20{\%} and DON a further 25 to 29{\%}. In general, fungicide efficacy was significantly higher for spring wheat than for soft winter wheat studies; depending on the fungicide, the difference in percent control between spring and soft winter wheat was 5 to 20{\%} for C(IND) and 7 to 16{\%} for C(DON). Based on the mean log ratios and between-study variances, the probability that IND or DON in a treated plot from a randomly selected study was lower than that in the check by a fixed margin was determined, which confirmed the superior efficacy of prothioconazole, metconazole, and tebuconzole+prothioconzole for Fusarium head blight disease and toxin control.},

  abstract = {An irrigated cropping systems experiment was conducted for 6 years in east-central Washington State to examine agronomic and economic alternatives to continuous annual winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) with burning and plowing, and to determine how root diseases of cereals are influenced by management practices. The continuous winter wheat treatment with burning and plowing was compared with a 3-year no-till rotation of winter wheat-spring barley (Hordeum vulgare)-winter canola (Brassica napus) and three straw management treatments: burning, straw removal, and leaving the straw stubble standing after harvest. Take-all disease and inoculum increased from years I to 4 in the continuous winter wheat treatment with burning and plowing, reducing plant growth compared to the no-till treatments with crop rotations. Inoculum of Rhizoctonia solani AG-8 was significantly lower in the tilled treatment compared to the no-till treatments. Inoculum concentration of Fusarium pseudograminearum was higher than that of F culmorum, and in one of three years, the former was higher in treatments with standing stubble and mechanical straw removal compared to burned treatments. Residue management method had no effect on Rhizoctonia inoculum, but spring barley had more crown roots and tillers and greater height with stubble burning. This 6-year study showed that irrigated winter wheat can be produced in a no-till rotation without major disease losses and demonstrated how cropping practices influence the dynamics of soilborne cereal diseases and inoculum over time.},
  annote   = {Paulitz, T. C. Schroeder, K. L. Schillinger, W. F. All experiments were contiuously cropped with wheat. And Irrigated The timing of irrigation varied from year to year, but the entire experiment received 380 mm of irrigation water every year with 150 mm applied in the fall and 230 mm applied in the spring. Water was applied via hand-line sprinklers, and the same irrigation timing was used for all crops. Average annual precipitation at the site during the 6-year study period was 221mm. Figu In Regards to Fusarium spp. There was no statistical difference between the mechanical removal of stubble and if the stubble was left standing. There was no statisitcal difference between plots where the stubble was burnt after each season and if it was burnt and tilled with a moundbourd plow However there was a statistical diferrence between; mechanical removal of stubble, stubble was left standing AND plots where the stubble was burnt after each season, and if it was burnt and tilled with a moundbourd plow Statistically significant year $\times$ treatment interactions for almost all of the variables measured suggest that variable environmental conditions each year play a strong role in disease expression. Another explanation is that disease and inoculum dynamics change over the course of a cropping system or rotation (29). For example, takeall increased over time in the continuous winter wheat treatment, and burning and plowing did not reduce this disease over the first 4 years of the rotation Plant parameters. Both tiller number and plant height of winter wheat were affected by residue treatment and interacted with year (P = 0.05 and},

fungicide treated and 8.1{}ha untreated) were conducted on growers' farms across four years, and twenty-five small plot (37.2 m2 or less) trials were conducted across the corn belt in 2010. Yield benefits from fungicides were much greater in the commercial-strip trials than in the small plot trials. In 2011, twenty-six large plot trials (ranging from 557 to 1394 m2), were established with efforts made to reduce border and alley effects. Two corn hybrids were evaluated at each of the 26 trial locations, and the results indicated that corn yield benefits from Quadris{\textregistered} fungicide (a solo formulation containing 22.9{\%} azoxystrobin) applied at the V4-V8 growth stage, Quilt Xcel{\textregistered} fungicide (a premix formulation containing 13.5{\%} azoxystrobin and 11.7{\%} propiconazole) applied at the R1 growth stage, or a combination of the two, provided yield benefits similar to those from the commercial-strip trials. The financial gain/loss from the use of fungicides was determined. Using the highest cost estimates for fungicide and applications, Quilt Xcel fungicide applied at the R1 growth stage provided estimated yield benefits of {\$}105, {\$}219, {\$}241, and {\$}278/ha ({\$}19, {\$}65, {\$}74, and {\$}89/A) over the untreated checks in the commercial-strip trials conducted in 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013, respectively. The average economic benefit to growers over the four year period was {\$}211{}$\pm${}37/ha ({\$}62{}$\pm${}{\$}15/A). Variability in economic benefit not only includes costs associated with fungicides but also includes annual commodity price, disease pressure, and location effects. This study supports the hypothesis that plot size influences assessment of yield effects of fungicides. Yield responses from the small plot, large plot, and commercial-strip trials resulted in increases of 378{}kg/Ha (6 Bu/A), 701{}kg/Ha (11 Bu/A), and 1132{}kg/Ha (18 Bu/A) over the untreated, respectively.},

  abstract  = {* $\bullet$Leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana grown under elevated or ambient CO2 (700 or 370{}$\mu$mol{}mol$-$1, respectively) were examined for physiological, biochemical and structural changes. * $\bullet$Stomatal characters, carbohydrate and mineral nutrient concentrations, leaf ultrastructure and plant hormone content were investigated using atomic absorption spectrophotometry, transmission electron microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). * $\bullet$Elevated CO2 reduced the stomatal density and stomatal index of leaves, and also reduced stomatal conductance and transpiration rate. Elevated CO2 increased chloroplast number, width and profile area, and starch grain size and number, but reduced the number of grana thylakoid membranes. Under elevated CO2, the concentrations of carbohydrates and plant hormones, with the exception of abscisic acid, increased whereas mineral nutrient concentrations declined. * $\bullet$These results suggest that the changes in chloroplast ultrastructure may primarily be a consequence of increased starch accumulation. Accelerated A.{}thaliana growth and development in elevated CO2 could in part be attributed to increased foliar concentrations of plant hormones. The reductions in mineral nutrient concentrations may be a result of dilution by increased concentrations of carbohydrates and also of decreases in stomatal conductance and transpiration rate.},

  abstract = {Secreted-in-xylem (SIX) proteins of the vascular wilt pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici are secreted during infection of tomato and function in virulence or avirulence. E oxysporum formae speciales have specific host ranges but the roles of SIX proteins in diverse hosts are unknown. We identified homologs of E oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici SIX1, SIX4, SIX8, and SIX9 in the genome of Arabidopsis infecting isolate Fo5176. A SIX4 homolog (termed Fo5176-SIX4) differed from that of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol-SIX4) by only two amino acids, and its expression was induced during infection of Arabidopsis. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing Fo5176-SIX4 had increased disease symptoms with Fo5176. Conversely, Fo5176-SIX4 gene knock-out mutants (Delta six4) had significantly reduced virulence on Arabidopsis, and this was associated with reduced fungal biomass and host jasmonate-mediated gene expression, the latter known to be essential for host symptom development. Full virulence was restored by complementation of Delta six4 mutants with either Fo5176-SIX4 or Fol-SIX4. Thus, Fo5176-SIX4 contributes quantitatively to virulence on Arabidopsis whereas, in tomato, Fol-SIX4 acts in host specificity as both an avirulence protein and a suppressor of other race-specific resistances. The strong sequence conservation for SIX4 in E oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici and Fo5176 suggests a recent common origin.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Plant pathogens often respond sensitively to changes in their environmental conditions and consequently represent a potentially important ecological response to global change. Although several studies have considered the effects of increased temperature and CO2 concentrations on plant pathogen risk, the effects of changing precipitation regimes have drawn less attention. Many classes of plant pathogen, however, are sensitive to changes in the water potential of their local environment. This study applied existing ecohydrological frameworks to connect precipitation, soil, and host properties with scenarios of pathogen risk, focusing on two water-sensitive pathogens: Phytophthora cinnamomi and Botryosphaeria doithidea. Simple models were developed to link the dynamics of these pathogens to water potentials. Model results demonstrated that the risk of host plants being colonized by the pathogens varied sensitively with soil and climate. The model was used to predict the distribution of Phytophthora in Western Australia and the severity of disease in horticultural blueberry trials with variable irrigation rates, illustrating potential applications of the framework. Extending the modeling framework to include spatial variation in hydrology, epidemic progression, and feedbacks between pathogens and soil moisture conditions may be needed to reproduce detailed spatial patterns of disease. At regional scales, the proposed modeling approach provides a tractable framework for coupling climatic drivers to ecosystem response while accounting for the probabilistic and variable nature of disease.},

The impacts of a changing climate on agricultural production in a world that warms by 4{$^{\circ}$}C or more are likely to be severe in places. The livelihoods of many croppers and livestock keepers in Africa are associated with diversity of options. The changes in crop and livestock production that are likely to result in a 4{$^{\circ}$}C+ world will diminish the options available to most smallholders. In such a world, current crop and livestock varieties and agricultural practices will often be inadequate, and food security will be more difficult to achieve because of commodity price increases and local production shortfalls. While adaptation strategies exist, considerable institutional and policy support will be needed to implement them successfully on the scale required. Even in the 2{$^{\circ}$}C+ world that appears inevitable, planning for and implementing successful adaptation strategies are critical if agricultural growth in the region is to occur, food security be achieved and household livelihoods be enhanced. As part of this effort, better understanding of the critical thresholds in global and African food systems requires urgent research.},

  abstract = {Spatial extrapolation of cropping systems models for regional crop growth and water use assessment and farm-level precision management has been limited by the vast model input requirements and the model sensitivity to parameter uncertainty. Remote sensing has been proposed as a viable source of spatial information for guiding model simulations, but techniques for merging remote sensing with cropping systems models have not been rigorously explored. We developed and tested two techniques for assimilation of remotely sensed green leaf area index (GLAI) into the CSM-CROPSIM-CERES-Wheat model: one based on model "updating" and the other based on model "forcing". A dataset from two wheat irrigation scheduling experiments, conducted at Maricopa, Arizona, during the winters of 2003-2004 and 2004-2005, provided canopy spectral reflectance information and measurements of canopy weight, wheat yield, and evapotranspiration (ET) under varying planting densities and nitrogen rates for testing the ability of the assimilation techniques to improve model simulations. Monte Carlo simulation methods were used to assess the performance of GLAI data assimilation in light of uncertainty in the model parameters that govern the GLAI simulation. When considering this uncertainty, assimilation of GLAI by "updating" and by "forcing" was able to reduce error between measured and simulated canopy weight and ET by 43.6{\%} and 56.5{\%} and by 45.0{\%} and 51.6{\%}, respectively, as compared to the stand-alone model. The assimilation techniques had greater difficulty improving wheat yield simulations because simulated yield was more sensitive to parameters other than GLAI, especially in the 2004-2005 growing season. Assimilation of remotely sensed data into cropping systems models has potential to improve simulations of key model outputs, such as canopy weight and ET, but further efforts are warranted to explore and fine-tune techniques for merging these two technologies.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic impacts increasingly drive ecological and evolutionary processes at many spatio-temporal scales, demanding greater capacity to predict and manage their consequences. This is particularly true for agro-ecosystems, which not only comprise a significant proportion of land use, but which also involve conflicting imperatives to expand or intensify production while simultaneously reducing environmental impacts. These imperatives reinforce the likelihood of further major changes in agriculture over the next 30-40years. Key transformations include genetic technologies as well as changes in land use. The use of evolutionary principles is not new in agriculture (e.g. crop breeding, domestication of animals, management of selection for pest resistance), but given land-use trends and other transformative processes in production landscapes, ecological and evolutionary research in agro-ecosystems must consider such issues in a broader systems context. Here, we focus on biotic interactions involving pests and pathogens as exemplars of situations where integration of agronomic, ecological and evolutionary perspectives has practical value. Although their presence in agro-ecosystems may be new, many traits involved in these associations evolved in natural settings. We advocate the use of predictive frameworks based on evolutionary models as pre-emptive management tools and identify some specific research opportunities to facilitate this. We conclude with a brief discussion of multidisciplinary approaches in applied evolutionary problems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Under constant light, ascospore discharge occurred at maximal rates at relative humidity levels greater than 92{\%}. When perithecia were placed under conditions of high external osmolarity, ascospore discharge was significantly reduced. Ascospores were discharged from asci along with droplets of fluid, the epiplasm, from within the ascus. Analysis of discharged epiplasmic fluid by GC-MASS Spectrometry revealed that mannitol was the major simple sugar component of the fluid. Activity of mannitol dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the conversion of fructose to mannitol, was higher in protein extracts from mature perithecia than in extracts from vegetative tissue. Several inhibitors of K+ and Ca++ ion channels inhibited ascospore discharge, which suggested that ascospore discharge resulted from the buildup of turgor pressure generated by ion fluxes and mannitol accumulation.},

In order to elucidate the resistance mechanisms involving heterotrimeric G proteins, we analyzed the effects of the G beta (subunit deficiency in the mutant agb1-2 on pathogenesis-related gene expression, as well as the genetic interaction between agb1-2 and a number of mutants of established defense pathways. G beta-mediated signaling suppresses the induction of salicylic acid (SA)-, jasmonic acid (JA)-, ethylene (ET)- and abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent genes during the initial phase of the infection with Fusarium oxysporum (up to 48 h after inoculation). However, at a later phase it enhances JA/ET-dependent genes such as PDF1.2 and PR4. Quantification of the Fusarium wilt symptoms revealed that G beta- and SA-deficient mutants were more susceptible than wild-type plants, whereas JA- and ET-insensitive and ABA-deficient mutants demonstrated various levels of resistance. Analysis of the double mutants showed that the G beta-mediated resistance to F. oxysporum and Alternaria brassicicola was mostly independent of all of the previously mentioned pathways. However, the progressive decay of agb1-2 mutants was compensated by coi1-21 and jin1-9 mutations, suggesting that at this stage of F. oxysporum infection G beta acts upstream of COI1 and ATMYC2 in JA signaling.},

Such model predictions are largely untested in the field, for lack of experimental data. We tested the CERES-Wheat model, modified to include leaf-level photosynthesis response to elevated CO2, using field data from 2 yr of Free-Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) experiments with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Yecora Rojo) in Mariclopa, AZ. Two irrigation treatments (well-watered, WW; water-deficit stressed, WS) and two atmospheric CO2 concentrations (ambient, 350 mu mol mol(-1); elevated, 550 mu mol mol(-1)) were simulated. The model was evaluated using measurements of crop phenology, aboveground dry matter (DM) production, grain yield, and evapotranspiration (ET). Model calculations of crop phenology were within 2 to 3 d of observed values under WW, ambient CO2 conditions in both years. The model did not simulate the accelerated crop phenology (5-8 d at physiological maturity) observed in the WW and elevated CO2 treatments, indicating the need to include effects of increased stomatal resistance on canopy temperature. Simulations of DM and grain yield were within 10{\%} of measured values, except for a tendency to overcalculate DM response to CO2 by 10 to 15{\%} in Year 1 for WS treatments. The model undercalculated cumulative ET under WW conditions by 15{\%}; model sensitivity analyses suggest that simulation of potential evapotranspiration (PET) was too low for this arid site. The model reproduced measured dynamics of CO2-water interactions. Simulated reductions in water loss due to elevated CO2 were about 4{\%}, in agreement with measurements. The model simulated larger increases in DM production and yield due to elevated CO2 under WS than under WW conditions. In Year 1, simulated crop response to CO2 was 2{\%} larger (measured: 3{\%}) under WS than under WW conditions; in Year 2, it was 11{\%} larger (measured: 9{\%}). The ability to simulate CO2-water interactions, though it needs to be further evaluated with additional experimental datasets, is an important attribute of models used to project crop yields under elevated CO2 and climate change.},

  abstract = {Crown rot and head blight of wheat are caused by the same Fusarium species. To better understand their biology, this study has compared 30 isolates of the three dominant species using 13 pathogenic and saprophytic fitness measures including aggressiveness for the two diseases, saprophytic growth and fecundity and deoxynivalenol (DON) production from saprophytic colonization of grain and straw. Pathogenic fitness was generally linked to DON production in infected tissue. The superior crown rot fitness of Fusarium pseudograminearum was linked to high DON production in the stem base tissue, while Fusarium culmorum and Fusarium graminearum had superior head blight fitness with high DON production in grains. Within each species, some isolates had similar aggressiveness for both diseases but differed in DON production in infected tissue to indicate that more than one mechanism controlled aggressiveness. All three species produced more DON when infecting living host tissue compared with saprophytic colonization of grain or straw, but there were significant links between these saprophytic fitness components and aggressiveness. As necrotrophic pathogens spend a part of their life cycle on dead organic matter, saprophytic fitness is an important component of their overall fitness. Any management strategy must target weaknesses in both pathogenic fitness and saprophytic fitness.},

These new races are virulent to most of the wheat seedling resistance genes limiting the resistance sources that can be used to combat this pathogen. High-temperature adult-plant (HTAP) stripe rust resistance has proven to be more durable than seedling resistance due to its non-race-specific nature, but its use is limited by the lack of mapping information. We report here the identification of a new HTAP resistance gene from Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides (DIC) designated as Yr36. Lines carrying this gene were susceptible to almost all the stripe rust pathogen races tested at the seedling stage but showed adult-plant resistance to the prevalent races in California when tested at high diurnal temperatures. Isogenic lines for this gene were developed by six backcross generations. Field tests in two locations showed increased levels of field resistance to stripe rust and increased yields in isogenic lines carrying the Yr36 gene compared to those without the gene. Recombinant substitution lines of chromosome 6B from DIC in the isogenic background of durum cv. Langdon were used to map the Yr36 gene on the short arm of chromosome 6B completely linked to Xbarc101, and within a 2-cM interval defined by PCR-based markers Xucw71 and Xbarc136. Flanking locus Xucw71 is also closely linked to the grain protein content locus Gpc-B1 (0.3-cM). Marker-assisted selection strategies are presented to improve stripe rust resistance and simultaneously select for high or low Gpc-B1 alleles.},

  abstract = {The genome of Fusarium oxysporum (Fo) consists of a set of eleven {\textquoteleft}core' chromosomes, shared by most strains and responsible for housekeeping, and one or several accessory chromosomes. We sequenced a strain of Fo f.sp. radicis-cucumerinum (Forc) using PacBio SMRT sequencing. All but one of the core chromosomes were assembled into single contigs, and a chromosome that shows all the hallmarks of a pathogenicity chromosome comprised two contigs. A central part of this chromosome contains all identified candidate effector genes, including homologs of SIX6, SIX9, SIX11 and SIX 13. We show that SIX6 contributes to virulence of Forc. Through horizontal chromosome transfer (HCT) to a non-pathogenic strain, we also show that the accessory chromosome containing the SIX gene homologs is indeed a pathogenicity chromosome for cucurbit infection. Conversely, complete loss of virulence was observed in Forc016 strains that lost this chromosome. We conclude that also a non-wilt-inducing Fo pathogen relies on effector proteins for successful infection and that the Forc pathogenicity chromosome contains all the information necessary for causing root rot of cucurbits. Three out of nine HCT strains investigated have undergone large-scale chromosome alterations, reflecting the remarkable plasticity of Fo genomes.},

The severity of disease epidemics and accumulation of associated trichothecene mycotoxins in wheat kernels is strongly driven by meteorological factors. The potential impacts of change in climate are reviewed from the perspective of the FGSC life cycle and host resistance mechanisms influenced by abiotic pressures at the ecological, physiological and molecular level. Alterations in climate patterns and cropping systems may affect the distribution, composition and load of FGSC inoculum, but quantitative information is lacking regarding the differential responses among FGSC members. In general, the coincidence of wet and warm environment during flowering enhances the risk of FHB epidemics, but the magnitude and direction of the change in FHB and mycotoxin risk will be a consequence of a multitude of effects...},

While rising atmospheric [CO2] is a driving force behind the warmer temperatures and drought, which aggravate fungal disease and mycotoxin accumulation, our understanding of how elevated [CO2] will effect maize defences against such pathogens is limited. Here we report that elevated [CO2] increases maize susceptibility to Fusarium verticillioides proliferation, while mycotoxin levels are unaltered. Fumonisin production is not proportional to the increase in F. verticillioides biomass, and the amount of fumonisin produced per unit pathogen is reduced at elevated [CO2]. Following F. verticillioides stalk inoculation, the accumulation of sugars, free fatty acids, lipoxygenase (LOX) transcripts, phytohormones and downstream phytoalexins is dampened in maize grown at elevated [CO2]. The attenuation of maize 13-LOXs and jasmonic acid production correlates with reduced terpenoid phytoalexins and increased susceptibility. Furthermore, the attenuated induction of 9-LOXs, which have been suggested to stimulate mycotoxin biosynthesis, is consistent with reduced fumonisin per unit fungal biomass at elevated [CO2]. Our findings suggest that elevated [CO2] will compromise maize LOX-dependent signalling, which will influence the interactions between maize and mycotoxigenic fungi.},

  abstract = {Several previous studies have addressed pheromone communication in various flour beetles (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), including the confused flour beetle, Tribolium confusum (du Val). Different stereoisomers of 4,8-dimethyldecanal (DMD) were reported as the only components of an aggregation pheromone, but the behavioral activity of DMD is low. In the present study, additional previously reported secondary metabolites (benzoquinones and hydrocarbons) were tested for electrophysiological activity (EAG) with both sexes of T. confusum. Two benzoquinones and three monoenic hydrocarbons elicited significant EAG activity from both male and female antennae. There was an elevated male EAG response (vs. the females) to two out of the three hydrocarbons and for both quinones. The EAG-active compounds were subsequently investigated for behavioral activity in a walking bioassay. Benzoquinones are considered toxic and have been assigned a function as alarm substances in flour beetles, but we found that methyl-1, 4-benzoquinone in intermediate concentrations was attractive to both male and female beetles and could therefore act as an aggregation pheromone component. Males were also attracted to ethyl-1,4-benzoquinone. The corresponding hydroquinones, presumed precursors of the benzoquinones, did not elicit any electrophysiological response and were not tested for behavioral activity. The unsaturated hydrocarbons (1-tetradecene, 1-pentadecene, and 1-hexadecene) elicited significant EAG responses from both male and female antennae and were also attractive in the behavioral assay. Our results show that several beetle-produced compounds, in addition to 4,8-dimethyldecanal, may be part of a complex pheromone system in flour beetles and play a role in mediating aggregation in T. confusum.},

  abstract  = {Crown rot (CR), caused by the fungus Fusarium pseudograminearum (Fp), is a constraint to wheat production in semi-arid regions globally with limited management options to control the disease. Fp is a stubble-borne pathogen hence inoculum becomes concentrated in the previous cereal rows in a no-till system. Two field experiments in northern New South Wales (NSW), Australia, were conducted to examine whether inter row sowing reduces the impact of CR. The first examined the effect of wheat stubble (standing stubble and slashed), row cleaners (moved sideways with row cleaners or undisturbed) and row placement (on or between rows) on the incidence and severity of Fp and yield of durum wheat [Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum (Desr.)] in a wheat--wheat sequence. The second examined row placement plus ground engaging tool (disc vs tine) imposed on Fp-moderately susceptible bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and Fp-very susceptible durum wheat varieties in a third consecutive wheat crop. In experiment 1; sowing between rows reduced incidence of Fp by 6{\%}, reduced whiteheads/m2 by 27{\%} and increased yield by 6{\%} compared with sowing on the row. Moving inoculum away from the sown row using row cleaners also reduced incidence of Fp (by 3.7{\%}) and whiteheads (by 13.6{\%}) but this did not express as an increase in yield. In experiment 2; sowing between rows led to a 12{\%} reduction in incidence of Fp compared with sowing on the row, but this did not translate into a significant yield advantage. Sowing with a tine increased plant establishment, tiller density and grain yield compared to sowing with a disc. Under high disease pressure, the Fp-moderately susceptible variety out-yielded the Fp-very susceptible variety by 20{\%}. Inter-row sowing provided a yield advantage when sowing a second consecutive wheat crop but it did not provide a yield advantage under a third cereal in sequence. Integrating the individual management tools (row placement, residue management, ground engaging tool, varietal choice) appear to be useful additions to integrated management to reduce the impact of CR in a no-till system.},

  abstract = {When the fungal pathogen Gibberella moniliformis (anamorph, Fusarium verticillioides) colonizes maize and maize-based products, it produces class B fumonisin (FB) mycotoxins, which are a significant threat to human and animal health. FB biosynthetic enzymes and accessory proteins are encoded by a set of clustered and cotranscribed genes collectively named FUM, whose molecular regulation is beginning to be unraveled by researchers. FB accumulation correlates with the amount of transcripts from the key FUM genes, FUM1, FUM21, and FUM8. In fungi in general, gene expression is often partially controlled at the chromatin level in secondary metabolism; when this is the case, the deacetylation and acetylation (and other posttranslational modifications) of histones are usually crucial in the regulation of transcription. To assess whether epigenetic factors regulate the FB pathway, we monitored FB production and FUM1, FUM21, and FUM8 expression in the presence of a histone deacetylase inhibitor and verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation the relative degree of histone acetylation in the promoter regions of FUM1, FUM21, and FUM8 under FB-inducing and noninducing conditions. Moreover, we generated transgenic F. verticillioides strains expressing GFP under the control of the FUM1 promoter to determine whether its strength under FB-inducing and noninducing conditions was influenced by its location in the genome. Our results indicate a clear and differential role for chromatin remodeling in the regulation of FUM genes. This epigenetic regulation can be attained through the modulation of histone acetylation at the level of the promoter regions of the key biosynthetic genes FUM1 and FUM21, but less so for FUM8.},

  abstract = {The re-emergence of fusarium head blight throughout the world and especially in Western Europe prompted a survey of the situation in the Netherlands. To allow for a high throughput screening of large numbers of samples, a diagnostic PCR method was developed to detect the most common species of Fusarium occurring on wheat. Seven primer pairs were tested for their ability to identify isolates of Fusarium avenaceum, F. culmorum, F. graminearum, F. poae, F. proliferatum and Microdochium nivale var. majus and M. nivale var. nivale. Each primer pair only generated a PCR product with the corresponding Fusarium species and all PCR fragments had different molecular sizes. This allowed the generation of these amplicons using a mixture of all seven primer pairs. The robustness of this multiplex PCR encouraged us to screen a large series of isolates collected in 2000 and 2001. In both years 40 fields were sampled leading to a collection of 209 isolates from 2000 and 145 isolates from 2001. The results of the multiplex PCR demonstrated that F. graminearum was the most abundant species in the Fusarium complex on wheat in both years. This is in sharp contrast to reports from the 1980s and early 1990s, which found F. culmorum as the predominant species. Primers derived from the tri7 and tri13 genes, which are implicated in the acetylation and oxygenation of the C-4 atom of the backbone of the trichothecene molecule, were used to discriminate between deoxynivalenol and nivalenol (NIV) producers. The populations of F. culmorum and F. graminearum both showed a slight increase in NIV-producers in 2001.},

An imperative exists, therefore, to elucidate the interactive effects of elevated C-a and drought on plant water relations of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). A spring wheat (cv. Yecora Rojo) crop was exposed to ambient (Control: 370 mu mol mol(-1)) and free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE: ambient + 180 mu mol mol(-1)) under ample (Wet), and reduced (Dry), water supplies (100 and 541{\%} replacement of evapotranspiration, respectively) over a 2-yr study. Our objective was to characterize and quantify the responses of 26 edaphic, gas exchange, water relations, carbohydrate pool dynamics, growth, and development parameters to rising C-a and drought. Increasing C-a minimized the deleterious effects of soil-water depiction by increasing drought avoidance (i.e., lower stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, and growth and development of a more robust root system) and drought tolerance (i.e., enhanced osmoregulation and adaptation of tissue) mechanisms, resulting in a 30{\%} reduction in water stress-induced midafternoon depressions in net assimilation rate. An elevated C-a-based increase in daily and seasonal carbon gain resulted in a positive feedback between source capacity (shoots) and sink demand (roots). Devoid of a concomitant rise in global temperature resulting from the rise in C-a, improved water relations for a herbaceous, cool-season, annual, C-3 cereal monocot grass (i.e., wheat) are anticipated in a future high-CO2 world. These findings are applicable to other graminaceous species of a similar function-type as wheat common to temperate zone grassland prairies and savannas, especially tinder dryland conditions.},

This 'Terrace' system has been used to seek alternative sources of resistance to crown rot in tetraploid and hexaploid wheats and to demonstrate that resistance in check cultivars is effective against both F. pseudograminearum and F. culmorum. Adult plant resistance in the cv. Kukri has been investigated using the Terraces and bulked segregant analysis of doubled haploid lines, and a resistance locus with polymorphic markers has been identified on chromosome 4B near the dwarfing gene Rht1.},

  abstract = {Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a trichothecene mycotoxin commonly produced by Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum during infection of cereal plants, such as wheat and barley. This toxin is a fungal virulence factor that facilitates the development of Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease. Wheat cultivar (cv.) Remus is susceptible to DON; the toxin causes premature bleaching of spikelets and inhibits root growth. This study used custom-made wheat cDNA arrays to analyse the effect of DON on the transcriptome of heads of the toxin-sensitive wheat cv. Remus at both 4 and 24 h post-toxin treatment. DON-induced transcripts encoded an array of proteins collectively associated with a range of cellular functions, such as metabolite transformation and detoxification, the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway, jasmonate biosynthesis and signalling, carbohydrate metabolism, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. This study is the first to demonstrate that the fungal virulence factor DON modulates jasmonate biosynthesis and signalling. It also highlights the fact that the toxin-mediated accumulation of transcripts associated with metabolite transformation and detoxification, proteolysis and phenylpropanoid accumulation is not unique to DON-resistant wheat genotypes. Therefore, the respective encoded proteins are likely part of the general wheat defence against DON. Comparative analysis of the results of this and other studies suggests that it is likely to be the rapidity and magnitude rather than the components of the response that are critical in determining resistance to DON and thus the spread of FHB disease in wheat heads.},

However, much of this information is contradictory and although it is widely recognised that nutrition can influence disease in crops, limited progress has been made in the manipulation of crop nutrition to enhance disease control. Achieving this aim requires a sound understanding of the effects of fertilisation on nutrient levels and availability in crop tissues, and in turn, how the nutrient status of such tissues influences pathogen infection, colonisation and sporulation. Some of these details are known for a number of crop plants under controlled conditions, but very little of this type of information is available for crops under field conditions. This review focuses on nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, potassium and silicon, examines the availability of these nutrients in plant tissues to support pathogen growth and development, and reviews the effects of the different nutrients on disease development. The review also examines the potential for manipulating crop nutrition to enhance disease control in conventional and organic cropping systems.},

  abstract = {Panama wilt disease, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, is a major threat to the cultivation of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.) in tropical and sub-tropical countries. Most varieties of banana, especially those belonging to the Silk group, are highly susceptible to this disease. The fungus can survive and spread through alternate hosts. Ornamental plant species belonging to other families in the order Zingiberales (to which the genus Musa belongs) and the order Alismatales may serve as alternate hosts, and thus transmit the disease to new areas. This study was therefore conducted to screen the infectivity of the pathogen on nine commercially important ornamental plant species using detached leaf tissue-based challenge methodology. Of the ornamental species studied, Dieffenbachia and Strelitzia were found to be completely resistant to the pathogen, as no lesions developed in these species. Alpinia zerumbet, A. purpurea, Heliconia indica, and H. psittacorum showed significant resistance, and lesion areas did not differ significantly from resistant control plants. Among the remaining species, the development of lesion areas in Canna indica, Aglaonema pictum, and Hedychium coronarium was highest, and was significantly higher than in the resistant controls (Ensete superbum). The cultivation, multiplication, and export of ornamental species such as C. indica, A. pictum, and H. coronarium should therefore be avoided in banana-growing hotspots of Panama wilt disease, as these species may serve as alternative hosts for the pathogen.},

Five lineages (A-E) were identified among 856 isolates. Of these, 12{\%} were strongly pathogenic on cotton, 10{\%} were weakly pathogenic and designated wild Fov, while 78{\%} were nonpathogenic. In contrast to the occurrence of pathogenic isolates in all five lineages in soils associated with wild Gossypium, in cotton growing areas only three lineages (A, B, E) occurred and all pathogenic isolates belonged to two subgroups in lineage A. One of these contained VCG 01111 isolates while the other contained VCG 01112 isolates. Sequence analyses of translation elongation factor-1$\alpha$, mitochondrial small subunit rDNA, nitrate reductase and phosphate permease confirmed that Australian Fov isolates were more closely related to lineage A isolates of native F. oxysporum than to Fov races 1-8 found overseas. These results strongly support a local evolutionary origin for Fov in Australian cotton growing regions. {\textcopyright} 2010 CSIRO.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The long-term effects of conservation management practices on greenhouse gas fluxes from tropical/subtropical croplands remain to be uncertain. Using both manual and automatic sampling chambers, we measured N2O and CH4 fluxes at a long-term experimental site (1968--present) in Queensland, Australia from 2006 to 2009. Annual net greenhouse gas fluxes (NGGF) were calculated from the 3-year mean N2O and CH4 fluxes and the long-term soil organic carbon changes. N2O emissions exhibited clear daily, seasonal and interannual variations, highlighting the importance of whole-year measurement over multiple years for obtaining temporally representative annual emissions. Averaged over 3 years, annual N2O emissions from the unfertilized and fertilized soils (90{}kg{}N{}ha$-$1{}yr$-$1 as urea) amounted to 138 and 902{}g{}N{}ha$-$1, respectively. The average annual N2O emissions from the fertilized soil were 388{}g{}N{}ha$-$1 lower under no-till (NT) than under conventional tillage (CT) and 259{}g{}N{}ha$-$1 higher under stubble retention (SR) than under stubble burning (SB). Annual N2O emissions from the unfertilized soil were similar between the contrasting tillage and stubble management practices. The average emission factors of fertilizer N were 0.91{\%}, 1.20{\%}, 0.52{\%} and 0.77{\%} for the CT-SB, CT-SR, NT-SB and NT-SR treatments, respectively. Annual CH4 fluxes from the soil were very small ($-$200--300{}g{}CH4{}ha$-$1{}yr$-$1) with no significant difference between treatments. The NGGF were 277--350{}kg{}CO2-e{}ha$-$1{}yr$-$1 for the unfertilized treatments and 401--710{}kg{}CO2-e{}ha$-$1{}yr$-$1 for the fertilized treatments. Among the fertilized treatments, N2O emissions accounted for 52--97{\%} of NGGF and NT-SR resulted in the lowest NGGF (401{}kg{}CO2-e{}ha$-$1{}yr$-$1 or 140{}kg{}CO2-e{}t$-$1 grain). Therefore, NT-SR with improved N fertilizer management practices was considered the most promising management regime for simultaneously achieving maximal yield and minimal NGGF.},

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V. Azoxystrobin is a widely used systemic fungicide in the Northeast of China, but it is unclear how azoxystrobin impacts the soil microbiome. Thus, we studied the impact of azoxystrobin on the microbial community structure and function in Chinese Spodosols. Field soil that had never been exposed to azoxystrobin was amended in laboratory batch experiments with 0 mg kg-1, 2 mg kg-1, 25 mg kg-1 and 50 mg kg-1 of azoxystrobin. Four soil enzymes (urease, invertase, phosphatase and catalase) were monitored to assess the impact of azoxystrobin on carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling as well as the microbial activity. The results show that the urease, invertase, and phosphatase (hydrolytic enzymes) activities was inhibited by as little as 2 mg kg$-$1 of azoxystrobin after 35 days, whereas the catalase (oxidoreductase enzyme) activity was promoted by the same concentration in most cases. Biolog Ecoplate analysis indicated that the utilization of different carbon sources was inhibited by azoxystrobin. 16S rRNA sequencing showed the bacterial operational taxonomic unit richness and the Shannon index decreased with increasing azoxystrobin concentration. Relative abundances of Sphingomonas decreased while Amycolatopsis and Sphingomonas increased by addition of increasing levels of azoxystrobin. In conclusion, azoxystrobin application to Spodosols leads to reduced urease, invertase, and phosphatase activities, which can impact nutrient cycling and carbon utilization. Furthermore, azoxystrobin application changed the microbiome community structure.},

  abstract = {Rising atmospheric CO(2) greatly enhances plant production, but its effect on biomass allocation, particularly in the presence of environmental stresses, is not well understood. Here, we used meta-analysis combined with pairwise techniques to examine root mass fraction (RMF; i.e., the fraction of root to total biomass) as affected by elevated CO(2) and environmental stresses. Our results showed that lower soil fertility increased RMF and the magnitude was similar for ambient and elevated CO(2)-grown plants. Lower soil water also increased RMF, but to a greater extent at elevated than at ambient CO(2). While CO(2) enrichment had little effect on the magnitude of O(3)-caused reduction in RMF in herbaceous species, it alleviated the adverse effect of higher O(3) on root production in woody species. These results demonstrate that CO(2) has less pronounced effects on RMF than other environmental factors. Under abiotic stresses, e.g., drought and higher O(3), elevated CO(2)-grown plants will likely increase biomass allocation below-ground. Because of the non-uniform changes in drought and O(3) projected for different parts of the world, we conclude that elevated CO(2) will have regional, but not global, effects on biomass allocation under various global change scenarios.},
