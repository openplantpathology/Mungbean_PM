abstract = {Strobilurins have been commercially used since 1996 for the control of Erysiphe graminis on cereals in Europe. Sensitivity monitoring of airborne and field samples of the pathogen detected only sensitive populations from 1996 to 1997, but in 1998 resistant wheat isolates (resistance factors of EC50s {\textgreater} 500) were found in airborne samples from three different regions in North Germany. These isolates already occurred at up to 90{\%} frequencies suggesting that resistant individuals may have high levels of fitness, and that they could have previously escaped detection with conventional methods which measure EC50s of bulk samples or which sample limited numbers of single-colony isolates per region. An alternative method measuring frequencies of resistant colonies in bulk samples at a discriminatory dose of 3 ppm trifloxystrobin relative to that at 0 ppm, showed that resistance to stobilurins can occur at frequencies which do not affect the mean EC50s of these samples. In 1999, high levels of resistance were still concentrated in parts of Germany but became detectable in other regions of the country, and in other countries including France, Belgium, UK and Denmark. Losses in performance were detected in areas with high frequencies of resistance. In a competition experiment between resistant and sensitive isolates over three generations, resistance was stable in the absence of selection; the resistant isolate appeared equal in fitness to the sensitive isolate on untreated plant material; and was rapidly selected for on strobilurin-treated material. Selection studies on bulk isolates confirmed this finding but also indicated the existence of a range of fitness levels. There were high levels of cross-resistance between strobilurins but not with demethylation inhibitors, morpholines, anilinopyrimidines and quinoxyfen. This assessment of resistance risk suggests that use recommendations of strobilurins for wheat powdery mildew control must include elements for strict resistance management. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Evidence-based health-care decision making requires comparisons of all relevant competing interventions. In the absence of randomized, controlled trials involving a direct comparison of all treatments of interest, indirect treatment comparisons and network meta-analysis provide useful evidence for judiciously selecting the best choice(s) of treatment. Mixed treatment comparisons, a special case of network meta-analysis, combine direct and indirect evidence for particular pairwise comparisons, thereby synthesizing a greater share of the available evidence than a traditional meta-analysis. This report from the ISPOR Indirect Treatment Comparisons Good Research Practices Task Force provides guidance on the interpretation of indirect treatment comparisons and network meta-analysis to assist policymakers and health-care professionals in using its findings for decision making. We start with an overview of how networks of randomized, controlled trials allow multiple treatment comparisons of competing interventions. Next, an introduction to the synthesis of the available evidence with a focus on terminology, assumptions, validity, and statistical methods is provided, followed by advice on critically reviewing and interpreting an indirect treatment comparison or network meta-analysis to inform decision making. We finish with a discussion of what to do if there are no direct or indirect treatment comparisons of randomized, controlled trials possible and a health-care decision still needs to be made.},

abstract = {Powdery mildew (PM) is a common and serious disease of mungbean [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek]. A few quantitative trait loci (QTL) for PM resistance in mungbean have been reported. The objective of this study was to locate QTL for PM resistance in two resistant accessions V4718 and RUM5. Simple sequence repeat markers were analyzed in an F2 population from a cross between Kamphaeng Saen 1 (KPS1; susceptible to PM) and V4718 (resistant to PM), and in F2 and BC1F1 populations from a cross between Chai Nat 60 (CN60; susceptible to PM) and RUM5 (resistant to PM). Progenies of 134 F2:3 and F2:4 lines derived from KPS1 × V4718, and 190 F2:3 and 74 BC1F1:2 lines derived from CN60 × RUM5 and CN60 × (CN60 × RUM5), respectively, were evaluated for response to PM under field conditions. Multiple interval mapping identified a major QTL on linkage group (LG) 9 and two minor QTL on LG4 for the resistance in V4718, and detected two major QTL on LG6 and LG9 and one minor QTL on LG4 for the resistance in RUM5. Comparative linkage analysis of the QTL for PM resistance in this study and in previous reports suggests that the resistance QTL on LG9 in V4718, RUM5, ATF3640 and VC6468-11-1A are the same locus or linked. One QTL on LG4 is the same in three sources (V4718, RUM5 and VC1210A). Another QTL on LG6 is the same in two sources (RUM5 and VC6468-11-1A). In addition, one QTL in V4718 on LG4 appears to be a new resistance locus. These different resistance loci will be useful for breeding durably PM-resistant mungbean cultivars. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Mungbean (Vigna radiata var. radiata) is a key legume crop grown predominantly in South and Southeast Asia. Biotic and abiotic stresses cause significant yield reduction in mungbean, and among these, fungal diseases are particularly important. Although disease management practices, including physical, chemical, and biological methods have been researched and described in the literature, few of these are available or have been used by growers. Here we review the economic impact, pathogen characterization, and sustainable management options for the soil-borne and foliar fungal diseases of mungbean as well as major challenges to manage these diseases. Potential use of all possible components of integrated management practices including host resistance, fungicides, biocontrol agents, natural plant products, and cultural practices etc. are discussed. Major diseases include powdery mildew, anthracnose, Cercospora leaf spot, Fusarium wilt, Rhizoctonia root rot and web blight, Macrophomina charcoal rot/dry root rot and blight. Review of the literature indicated an absence of resistance to Rhizoctonia root rot, little sources of resistance for dry root rot and anthracnose. Major resistant genes (R genes) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified for powdery mildew and Cercospora leaf spot, which may be potentially used in Marker assisted selection (MAS). has been used in resistance breeding for both of the latter. Although the mechanisms of induced systemic resistance (ISR) by biocontrol agents have been studied with Macrophomina blight, there is little information on the mechanisms and use of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in managing fungal diseases of mungbean. Several studies targeted exploiting biological control for soil-borne root rot diseases. Botanical products, such as plant extracts, are also found effective to manage root and foliar diseases. However, many of these studies were limited to laboratory and/or green house experiments. Thus, long-term field studies are required for further exploitation of biological methods and commercial applications.},

abstract = {Mungbean (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek) in Australia has been transformed from a niche opportunistic crop into a major summer cropping option for dryland growers in the summer-dominant rainfall regions of Queensland and New South Wales. This transformation followed stepwise genetic improvements in both grain yields and disease resistance. For example, more recent cultivars such as ‘Crystal', ‘Satin II', and ‘Jade-AU‘have provided up to a 20{\%} yield advantage over initial introductions. Improved agronomic management to enable mechanised management and cultivation in narrow ({\textless}50 cm) rows has further promised to increase yields. Nevertheless, average yields achieved by growers for their mungbean crops remain less than 1 t/ha, and are much more variable than other broad acre crops. Further increases in yield and crop resilience in mungbean are vital. In this review, opportunities to improve mungbean productivity have been analysed at four key levels including phenology, leaf area development, dry matter accumulation, and its partitioning into grain yield. Improving the prediction of phenology in mungbean may provide further scope for genetic improvements that better match crop duration to the characteristics of target environments. There is also scope to improve grain yields by increasing dry matter production through the development of more efficient leaf canopies. This may introduce additional production risks as dry matter production depends on the amount of available water, which varies considerably within and across growing regions in Australia. Improving crop yields by exploiting G × E × M interactions related to cultivar photo-thermal sensitivities and make better use of available water in these variable environments is likely to be a less risky strategy. Improved characterisation of growing environments using modelling approaches could also better define and identify the risks of major abiotic constraints. This would assist in optimising breeding and management strategies to increase grain yield and crop resilience in mungbean for the benefit of growers and the industry.},

abstract = {Mungbean (Vigna radiata L.), as a dryland grain legume, is exposed to varying timing and severity of water deficit, which results in variability in grain yield, nitrogen accumulation and grain quality. In this field study, mungbean crops were exposed to varying timing and severity of water deficit in order to examine: (1) contribution of the second flush of pods to final grain yield with variable timing of relief from water deficit, (2) the sensitivity to water deficit of the accumulation of biomass and nitrogen (N) and its partitioning to grain, and (3) how the timing of water deficit affects the pattern of harvest index (HI) increase through pod filling. The results showed that the contribution of the second flush to final yield is highly variable (1-56{\%}) and can be considerable, especially where mid-season stress is relieved at early pod filling. The capacity to produce a second flush of pods did not compensate fully for yield reduction due to water stress. Relief from mid-season stress also resulted in continued leaf production, N2 fixation and vegetative biomass accumulation during pod filling. Despite the wide variation in the degree of change in vegetative biomass and N during pod filling, there were strong relationships between grain yield and net-above-ground biomass at maturity, and grain N and above-ground N at maturity. Only in the extreme situations were HI and nitrogen HI affected noticeably. In those treatments where there was a large second flush of pods, there was a pronounced biphasic pattern to pod number production, with HI also progressing through two distinct phases of increase separated by a plateau. The proportion of grain yield contributed to by biomass produced before pod filling varied from 0 to 61{\%} with the contribution greatest under terminal water deficit. There was a larger effect of water deficit on N accumulation, and hence N2 fixation, than on biomass accumulation. The study confirmed the applicability of a number of long-standing physiological concepts to the analysis of the effect of water deficit on mungbean, but also highlighted the difficulty of accounting for timing effects of water deficit where second flushes of pods alter canopy development, biomass and yield accumulation, and N dynamics.

abstract = {Meta-analysis, the methodology for analyzing the results from multiple independent studies, has grown tremendously in popularity over the last four decades. Although most meta-analyses involve a single effect size (summary result, such as a treatment difference) from each study, there are often multiple treatments of interest across the network of studies in the analysis. Multi-treatment (or network) meta-analysis can be used for simultaneously analyzing the results from all the treatments. However, the methodology is considerably more complicated than for the analysis of a single effect size, and there have not been adequate explanations of the approach for agricultural investigations. We review the methods and models for conducting a network meta-analysis based on frequentist statistical principles, and demonstrate the procedures using a published multi-treatment plant pathology data set. A major advantage of network meta-analysis is that correlations of estimated treatment effects are automatically taken into account when an appropriate model is used. Moreover, treatment comparisons may be possible in a network meta-analysis that are not possible in a single study because all treatments of interest may not be included in any given study. We review several models that consider the study effect as either fixed or random, and show how to interpret model-fitting output. We further show how to model the effect of moderator variables (study-level characteristics) on treatment effects, and present one approach to test for the consistency of treatment effects across the network. Online supplemental files give explanations on fitting the network meta-analytical models using SAS.},

abstract = {The aim of this analysis was to estimate the effect sizes and consistency of products evaluated for fire blight control in the eastern United States over the last decade. Because only 3{\%} of the 69 studies published from 2000 to 2008 explicitly presented a measure of within-study variability, a method for estimating the least significant difference (LSD) and, hence the sampling variance, for studies with at least two significant mean separations in the presented mean multiple comparisons was developed. Lin's concordance analysis indicated that the estimated LSD was an accurate predictor of the actual LSD based on 35 studies in a calibration evaluation ($\rho$(c) = 0.997). Separate multi-treatment random-effects meta-analyses were performed for three control categories: antibiotics, biological control, and plant defense-activating products and mean log response ratios relative to the nontreated controls ([Formula: see text]) were computed for each treatment and then back-transformed to obtain the mean percent disease control. None of the products evaluated performed as well as streptomycin, the standard product for fire blight control, for which the mean disease control was 68.6{\%}. As a group, experimental antibiotics provided the best fire blight control with mean effect sizes ranging from 59.7 to 61.7{\%}. Among the biological controls, the best control was noted for treatments combining the antibiotic streptomycin with a product based on Pantoea agglomerans (55.0{\%} mean disease reduction) or Bacillus subtilis (53.9{\%}). Mean disease control was 31.9, 25.7, and 22.6{\%}, respectively, for products based on B. subtilis, Pantoea agglomerans, and Pseudomonas fluorescens without an antibiotic, suggesting that the higher efficacy of the combination treatments was due to the antibiotic. Among the plant defense-activating products, prohexadione calcium had the highest and most consistent effect size (50.7{\%} control), while other products provided modest mean disease control of between 6.1 and 25.8{\%}. Percent control values were significantly moderated by study location and cultivar used in the study, and were smaller, but more variable, when products were tested under high disease intensity compared with low disease intensity. Results indicate that wide-scale use of biological control and plant defense-activating products in the eastern United States is likely to remain low.},

abstract = {The metafor package provides functions for conducting meta-analyses in R . The package includes functions for fitting the meta-analytic fixed- and random-effects models and allows for the inclusion of moderators variables (study-level covariates) in these models. Meta-regression analyses with continuous and categorical moderators can be conducted in this way. Functions for the Mantel-Haenszel and Peto's one-step method for meta-analyses of 2 x 2 table data are also available. Finally, the package provides various plot functions (for example, for forest, funnel, and radial plots) and functions for assessing the model fit, for obtaining case diagnostics, and for tests of publication bias.},

abstract = {Paul, P. A., Lipps, P. E., Hershman, D. E., McMullen, M. P., Draper, M. A., and Madden, L. V. 2007. A quantitative review of tebuconazole effect on Fusarium head blight and deoxynivalenol content in wheat. Phytopathology 97:211-220. A meta-analysis of the effect of tebuconazole (e.g., Folicur 3.6F) on Fusarium head blight and deoxynivalenol (DON) content of wheat grain was performed using data collected from uniform fungicide trials (UFTs) conducted at multiple locations across U.S. wheat-growing regions. Response ratios (mean disease and DON levels from tebuconazole-treated plots, divided by mean disease and DON levels from untreated check plots) were calculated for each of 139 studies for tebuconazole effect on Fusarium head blight index (IND; field or plot-level disease severity, i.e., mean proportion of diseased spikelets per spike) and 101 studies for tebuconazole effect on DON contamination of harvested grain. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed on the log-transformed ratios, and the estimated mean log ratios were transformed to estimate the mean (expected) percent control for IND (IND C) and DON (DON C). A mixed-effects meta-analysis was then done to determine the effects of wheat type (spring versus winter wheat) and disease and DON levels in the controls on the log ratios. Tebuconazole was more effective at limiting IND than DON, with IND C and DON C values of 40.3 and 21.6{\%}, respectively. The efficacy of tebuconazole as determined by the impact on both IND and DON was greater in spring wheat than in winter wheat (P {\textless} 0.01), with a 13.2{\%} higher IND C and a 12.4{\%} higher DON C in spring wheat than in winter wheat. In general, IND C and DON C were both at their lowest values (and not significantly different from 0) when mean IND and DON in the controls, respectively, were low (≤2{\%} for IND and {\textless}1 ppm for DON). IND C was 25{\%} higher in studies with mean IND between 2 and 15{\%} than in studies with mean IND ≤ 2{\%}, whereas DON C was 28.8{\%} higher in studies with mean DON between 1 and 10 ppm than in studies with mean DON {\textless} 1 ppm. The between-study variance was significantly greater than 0 (P {\textless} 0.01), indicating considerable (unexplained) variability in percent control.},

abstract = {Meta-analysis is the analysis of the results of multiple studies, which is typically performed in order to synthesize evidence from many possible sources in a formal probabilistic manner. In a simple sense, the outcome of each study becomes a single observation in the meta-analysis of all available studies. The methodology was developed originally in the social sciences by Smith, Glass, Rosenthal, Hunter, and Schmidt, based on earlier pioneering contributions in statistics by Fisher, Pearson, Yates, and Cochran, but this approach to research synthesis has now been embraced within many scientific disciplines. However, only a handful of articles have been published in plant pathology and related fields utilizing meta-analysis. After reviewing basic concepts and approaches, methods for estimating parameters and interpreting results are shown. The advantages of meta-analysis are presented in terms of prediction and risk analysis, and the high statistical power that can be achieved for detecting significant effects of treatments or significant relationships between variables. Based on power considerations, the fallacy of na{\"{i}}ve counting of P values in a narrative review is demonstrated. Although there are many advantages to meta-analysis, results can be biased if the analysis is based on a nonrepresentative sample of study outcomes. Therefore, novel approaches for characterizing the upper bound on the bias are discussed, in order to show the robustness of meta-analysis to possible violation of assumptions. {\textcopyright} 2011 The American Phytopathological Society.},
