abstract = {Evidence-based health-care decision making requires comparisons of all relevant competing interventions. In the absence of randomized, controlled trials involving a direct comparison of all treatments of interest, indirect treatment comparisons and network meta-analysis provide useful evidence for judiciously selecting the best choice(s) of treatment. Mixed treatment comparisons, a special case of network meta-analysis, combine direct and indirect evidence for particular pairwise comparisons, thereby synthesizing a greater share of the available evidence than a traditional meta-analysis. This report from the ISPOR Indirect Treatment Comparisons Good Research Practices Task Force provides guidance on the interpretation of indirect treatment comparisons and network meta-analysis to assist policymakers and health-care professionals in using its findings for decision making. We start with an overview of how networks of randomized, controlled trials allow multiple treatment comparisons of competing interventions. Next, an introduction to the synthesis of the available evidence with a focus on terminology, assumptions, validity, and statistical methods is provided, followed by advice on critically reviewing and interpreting an indirect treatment comparison or network meta-analysis to inform decision making. We finish with a discussion of what to do if there are no direct or indirect treatment comparisons of randomized, controlled trials possible and a health-care decision still needs to be made.},

abstract = {Background: Several reviews have noted shortcomings regarding the quality and reporting of network meta-analyses (NMAs). We suspect that this issue may be partially attributable to limitations in current NMA software which do not readily produce all of the output needed to satisfy current guidelines. Results: To better facilitate the conduct and reporting of NMAs, we have created an R package called "BUGSnet" (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling to conduct a Network meta-analysis). This R package relies upon Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS) to conduct Bayesian NMA using a generalized linear model. BUGSnet contains a suite of functions that can be used to describe the evidence network, estimate a model and assess the model fit and convergence, assess the presence of heterogeneity and inconsistency, and output the results in a variety of formats including league tables and surface under the cumulative rank curve (SUCRA) plots. We provide a demonstration of the functions contained within BUGSnet by recreating a Bayesian NMA found in the second technical support document composed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit (NICE-DSU). We have also mapped these functions to checklist items within current reporting and best practice guidelines.},

The treatments comprised: CO2 at elevated and ambient conditions; and N at 150 and 250 kg/ha. The increase in wheat biomass averaged between 28.3 and 44.5{\%}, where the response was significant and highest at jointing stage. Under low and high N conditions, the biomass for leaves, shoots, ears and roots increased significantly by 36.8 and 40.9{\%}, 91.2 and 53.2{\%}, 89.4 and 52.2{\%}, and 55.5 and 67.9{\%}, respectively. N content in wheat decreased by 3.6-25.3{\%}, on average, due to elevated CO2 at both N levels and decreased more at low than at high N conditions. On the other hand, N uptake significantly increased by 20.8 and 29.2{\%} at low and high N, respectively, at jointing stage and by 1.6-32.4{\%} at other growth stages. Under elevated CO2 conditions, the relative absorption rate was 37.6{\%} at high N conditions, while the opposite was observed under ambient conditions at jointing stage.},

abstract = {'Super Dwarf' wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants have been grown from seed to maturity in the Mir space station where they were periodically exposed, because of microgravity and other constraints, to water deficit, waterlogging, high CO2 levels, and low light intensities. The plants produced many tillers, but none of them produced viable seed, Studies have been initiated to determine why the plants responded in these ways. In the present study, effects of the listed stresses on abscisic acid (ABA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and isopentenyl adenosine ([9R]iP) levels in roots and leaves of plants grown under otherwise near optimal conditions on earth were measured. Hormones were extracted,. purified by HPLC, and quantified by noncompetitive indirect ELISA. In response to water deficit, ABA levels increased in roots and leaves, IAA levels decreased in roots and leaves, and [9R]iP levels increased in leaves but decreased in roots. In response to waterlogging, ABA, IAA and [9R]iP levels briefly increased in roots and leaves and then decreased. When portions of the root system were exposed to waterlogging and/or water deficit, ABA levels in leaves increased while [9R]iP and IAA levels decreased, These responses were correlated with the percentage of the root system stressed. At a low photosynthetic photon flux (100 mumol m(-2) s(-1)), plants grown in continuous light had higher leaf ABA levels than plants grown using an 18 or 21 h photoperiod.},

abstract = {The effect of modified atmospheres on the growth and fumonisin B-1 production of Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium proliferatum on corn is presented in a series of two papers. In this, the first part, the effect of initial headspace (IH) carbon dioxide concentration and its interaction with water activity (a(w)) on growth and fumonisin B-1 production was evaluated. It was observed that at all a(w) values studied, increase in the IH CO2 concentration generally resulted in a decrease in the colony growth rate (g, min day(-1)) and maximum colony diameter (D-max, mm) and an increase in the lag phase duration (lambda, day). Although both a(w) and IH CO2 concentration had significant and synergistic effects on g, a(w) had the largest effect. As little as 10{\%} IH CO2 completely inhibited the production of fumonisin B-1 by F verticillioides. F proliferatum was more resistant and required 40, 30 and 10{\%} 111 CO2 at a(w) 0.984, 0.951 and 0.930, respectively, to completely inhibit fumonisin B-1 production. These results demonstrate that modified atmospheres containing high CO2 levels could potentially be employed for the protection of corn from fungal spoilage and mycotoxin contamination during the post-harvest period.

abstract = {Fungal secondary metabolites confer an indiscriminate resource of bioactive compounds with both pharmaceutical and industrial relevance. Synthesis of these compounds is tightly controlled through regulatory networks. These networks act in response to the environmental conditions in which the fungus grows. One class of fungal secondary metabolites that have drawn increased attention, is the polyketides produced by a high number of fungi and bacteria. The increasing number of publicly available genomic sequences of filamentous fungi, combined with new and highly efficient DNA-cloning techniques, has allowed the use of new efficient approaches to study the regulation and synthesis of these compounds. With the availability of new molecular genetic tools, a new bottleneck has occurred in fungal molecular biology; the analytical chemical analysis of the generated transgenic mutants. In this study, a method based on PARAFAC data analysis of HPLC data is presented and shown useful for gaining overview of complex and diverse datasets. Further, the strain specific and nutrient dependent regulation of polyketide synthesis is discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {To identify future impacts on biomass production and yield quality of important C 3 crops, spring wheat was grown in association with 13 weed species in a Mini-FACE (free-air carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment) system under ambient (375 mu l l(-1)) and elevated (526 mu l l(-1)) CO2 concentrations. Wheat productivity was assessed at maturity and grain yield was subjected to various chemical analyses and baking quality tests. CO2 enrichment, acted as carbon 'fertiliser' and increased the aboveground biomass production of wheat by 18.8{\%} as there was a trend towards higher stein biomass. Although not statistically significant, wheat grain yield was increased by 13.4{\%} due to a significant establishment of more grains per unit ground area. At the same time, thousand grain weight was non-significantly shifted towards smaller grain size classes, which may result in negative consequences for the crop market value. As a result of the CO2-induced physiological and biochemical modifications, concentration of total grain protein was significantly decreased by 3.5{\%}, reducing the wheat grain quality with potentially far-reaching impacts on the nutritional value and use for processing industry. Although often not significant, the concentrations of amino acids per unit of flour were decreased by 0.2 to 8.3{\%} due to elevated CO2 thereby affecting the composition of proteinogenic amino acids. Furthermore, gluten proteins tended to decline. Within the significant decreased gliadins, alpha- and omega 5-gliadins were significantly reduced under CO2 enrichment; there was also a negative trend for omega 1,2- and gamma-gliadins. Changes in certain essential minerals were found as well, although not statistically significant. Concentrations of sodium, calcium, phosphorus and sulphur were slightly lowered and those of potassium and magnesium were slightly increased due to CO2 enrichment. The micro-element molybdenum was increased, while concentrations of iron, zinc, copper, manganese and aluminium were decreased. With regard to rheological and baking parameters defining the cereal quality for industrial processing, the resistance of the dough was significantly reduced by about 30{\%}, while the extensibility was non-significantly increased by 17.1{\%} under CO2 enrichment. Moreover, the bread volume was decreased non-significantly by about 9{\%}. Elevated CO2 is obviously affecting grain characteristics important for consumer nutrition and health, industrial processing and marketing. Experimental evidence for these changes is still poor but deserves further attention.},

The potential range of F. acuminatum ssp. acuminatum was southern and eastern Australia, with its distribution limited by high temperatures. Fusarium acuminatum ssp. armeniacum was predicted to occur only in a limited higher rainfall, temperate area in south-eastern Australia, but climate may be only a secondary factor in determining its distribution. The potential range of F. compactum was most of mainland Australia except the southern coastal fringe and south-east highlands from which it was excluded by low temperatures. No significant climatic limits to the distribution of F. equiseti were found and its potential range was the whole of Australia. Fusarium longipes had a potential range in the higher rainfall areas of the tropics and subtropics, and it was excluded from other areas by low summer rainfall or low temperatures in the wet season. Fusarium scirpi had a potential range over most of temperate and arid Australia, but was excluded from areas that were too cold, where winter rainfall was more than twice the summer rainfall, and from the hot summer rainfall areas of the tropics.},

abstract = {Historical records of precipitation, streamflow and drought indices all show increased aridity since 1950 over many land areas(1,2). Analyses of model-simulated soil moisture(3,4), drought indices(1,5,6) and precipitation-minus-evaporation(7) suggest increased risk of drought in the twenty-first century. There are, however, large differences in the observed and model-simulated drying patterns(1,2,6). Reconciling these differences is necessary before the model predictions can be trusted. Previous studies(8-12) show that changes in sea surface temperatures have large influences on land precipitation and the inability of the coupled models to reproduce many observed regional precipitation changes is linked to the lack of the observed, largely natural change patterns in sea surface temperatures in coupled model simulations(13). Here I show that the models reproduce not only the influence of El Nino-Southern Oscillation on drought over land, but also the observed global mean aridity trend from 1923 to 2010. Regional differences in observed and model-simulated aridity changes result mainly from natural variations in tropical sea surface temperatures that are often not captured by the coupled models. The unforced natural variations vary among model runs owing to different initial conditions and thus are irreproducible. I conclude that the observed global aridity changes up to 2010 are consistent with model predictions, which suggest severe and widespread droughts in the next 30-90 years over many land areas resulting from either decreased precipitation and/or increased evaporation.},

abstract = {Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and vegetative compatibility analyses were undertaken to assess genetic relationships among 52 isolates of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum of worldwide origin and representing race A, 3, or 4 on cotton plants. Ten distinct vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) were obtained, and isolates belonging to distinct races were never in the same VCG. Race A isolates were separated into eight VCGs, whereas isolates of race 3 were classified into a single VCG (0113), as were those of race 4 (0114). Ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA (rDNA and mtDNA) RFLPs separated four rDNA haplotypes and seven mtDNA haplotypes. Race A isolates displayed the most polymorphism, with three rDNA haplotypes and four mtDNA haplotypes; race 4 isolates formed a single rDNA group but exhibited three mtDNA haplotypes, while race 3 isolates had unique rDNA and mtDNA haplotypes. Two mtDNA molecules with distinct sizes were identified; the first (45-kb mtDNA) was found in all race A isolates and seven race 4 isolates, and the second (55-kb mtDNA) was found in all race 3 isolates and in two isolates of race 4. These two mtDNA molecules were closely related to mtDNAs of F. oxysporum isolates belonging to other formae speciales (conglutinans, lycopersici, matthioli, and raphani). Isolates within a VCG shared the same rDNA and mtDNA haplotypes, with the exception of VCG0114, in which three distinct mtDNA haplotypes were observed. Genetic relationships among isolates inferred from rDNA or mtDNA site restriction data were different, and there was not a strict correlation between race and RFLPs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {As any epidemic on plants is driven by the amount of susceptible tissue, and the distance between organs, any modification in the host population, whether quantitative or qualitative, can have an impact on the epidemic dynamics. In this paper we examine using examples described in the literature, the features of the host plant and the use of crop management which are likely to decrease diseases. We list the pathogen processes that can be affected by crop growth and architecture modifications and then determine how we can highlight the principal ones. In most cases, a reduction in plant growth combined with an increase in plant or crop porosity reduces infection efficiency and spore dispersal. Experimental approaches in semi-controlled conditions, with concomitant characterisation of the host, microclimate and disease, allow a better understanding and analysis of the processes impacted. Afterwards, the models able to measure and predict the effect of plant growth and architecture on epidemic behaviour are reviewed.},

@article{Wherrett2003a,
abstract = {A study was carried out to establish key developmental stages of Leptosphaeria maculans on canola residues leading up to ascospore discharge and how these stages could be affected by chemicals. The residues were dipped in a range of chemicals, including fungicides, herbicides, and surfactants, to determine possible manipulative effects of the chemicals on the development of the fungus including ascospore discharge. Treated residues were placed in the field during the growing season. Ascospore discharge was found to be closely related to pseudothecial maturity and density. There was no significant difference between pseudothecial maturation on the crown component compared with the stem component. A high correlation between rainfall and pseudothecial density suggested that rainfall was a good complimentary indicator for timing of ascospore discharge. These results may provide the canola industry with a potential method of monitoring pseudothecial development for estimating disease hazards. This would allow manipulation of sowing times so as to minimise or avoid heavy ascospore showers coinciding with the early seedling phase. Twenty chemical treatments showed significant efficacy in decreasing ascospore numbers early in the season, most often by delaying the development of the pseudothecia on the residues. Two scenarios were formulated giving growers the potential to manipulate pseudothecial development and/or ascospore discharge. Firstly, a number of chemicals, such as fluquinconazole, technical grade flutriafol, and gluphosinate-ammonium, were able to delay pseudothecial development and subsequent ascospore discharge was decreased by 100{\%}, 99{\%}, and 96{\%}, respectively. This scenario gives growers the potential to minimise synchronisation of ascospore discharge with early crop establishment. Secondly, a situation where pseudothecial development is not delayed, but number of ascospores discharged is reduced (e.g. ziram by 45{\%}) would only be effective if the reduction resulted in a less severe disease epidemic. There is significant potential for development of commercial chemical treatments of residues to reduce disease pressure on seedlings.},

abstract = {Contributions to historical climate change have varied substantially among nations. These differences reflect underlying inequalities in wealth and development, and pose a fundamental challenge to the implementation of a globally equitable climate mitigation strategy. This Letter presents a new way to quantify historical inequalities among nations using carbon and climate debts, defined as the amount by which national climate contributions have exceeded a hypothetical equal per-capita share over time. Considering only national CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, accumulated carbon debts across all nations from 1990 to 2013 total 250 billion tonnes of CO2, representing 40{\%} of cumulative world emissions since 1990. Expanding this to reflect the temperature response to a range of emissions, historical climate debts accrued between 1990 and 2010 total 0.11 °C, close to a third of observed warming over that period. Large fractions of this debt are carried by industrialized countries, but also by countries with high levels of deforestation and agriculture. These calculations could contribute to discussions of climate responsibility by providing a tangible way to quantify historical inequalities, which could then inform the funding of mitigation, adaptation and the costs of loss and damages in those countries that have contributed less to historical warming.},

@article{Manning1995a,
abstract = {Continued world population growth results in increased emission of gases from agriculture, combustion of fossil fuels, and industrial processes. This causes changes in the chemical composition of the atmosphere. Evidence is emerging that increased solar ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation is reaching the earth's atmosphere, due to stratospheric ozone depletion. Carbon dioxide (CO2), ozone (O-3) and UV-B are individual climate change factors that have direct biological effects on plants. Such effects may directly or indirectly affect the incidence and severity of plant diseases, caused by biotic agents. Carbon dioxide may increase plant canopy size and density, resulting in a greater biomass of high nutritional quality, combined with a much higher microclimate relative humidity. This would be likely to promote plant diseases such as rusts, powdery mildews, leaf spots and blights. Inoculum potential from greater overwintering crop debris would also be increased. Ozone is likely to have adverse effects on plant growth. Necrotrophic pathogens may colonize plants weakened by O-3 at an accelerated rare, while obligate biotroph infections may be lessened. Ozone is unlikely to have direct adverse effects on fungal pathogens. Ozone effects on plant diseases are host plant mediated. The principal effects of increased UV-B on plant diseases would be via alterations in host plants. Increased flavonoids could lead to increased diseased resistance. Reduced net photosynthesis and premature ripening and senescence could result in a decrease in diseases caused by biotrophs and an increase in those caused by necrotrophs. Microbial plant pathogens are less likely to be adversely affected by CO2, O-3 and UV-B than are their corresponding host plants. Changes in host plants may result in expectable alterations of disease incidence, depending on host plant growth stages and type of pathogen. Given the importance of plant diseases in world food and fiber production, it is essential to begin studying the effects of increased CO2, O-3 and UV-B (and other climate change factors) on plant diseases. We know very little about the actual impacts of climate change factors on disease epidemiology. Epidemiologists should be encouraged to consider CO2, O-3 and UV-B as factors in their field studies.},

abstract = {Background: "Open peer review" (OPR), despite being a major pillar of Open Science, has neither a standardized definition nor an agreed schema of its features and implementations. The literature reflects this, with numerous overlapping and contradictory definitions. While for some the term refers to peer review where the identities of both author and reviewer are disclosed to each other, for others it signifies systems where reviewer reports are published alongside articles. For others it signifies both of these conditions, and for yet others it describes systems where not only "invited experts" are able to comment. For still others, it includes a variety of combinations of these and other novel methods. Methods: Recognising the absence of a consensus view on what open peer review is, this article undertakes a systematic review of definitions of "open peer review" or "open review", to create a corpus of 122 definitions. These definitions are systematically analysed to build a coherent typology of the various innovations in peer review signified by the term, and hence provide the precise technical definition currently lacking. Results: This quantifiable data yields rich information on the range and extent of differing definitions over time and by broad subject area. Quantifying definitions in this way allows us to accurately portray exactly how ambiguously the phrase "open peer review" has been used thus far, for the literature offers 22 distinct configurations of seven traits, effectively meaning that there are 22 different definitions of OPR in the literature reviewed. Conclusions: I propose a pragmatic definition of open peer review as an umbrella term for a number of overlapping ways that peer review models can be adapted in line with the aims of Open Science, including making reviewer and author identities open, publishing review reports and enabling greater participation in the peer review process.},

Both DON and ZEN showed a wide variability among areas; the TOX-risk was very variable, ranging from {\textless}10 (low-risk) to {\textgreater}60 (high-risk).

Plant Dis. 95:1099-1108. Distribution of Fusarium crown rot (FCR) and common root rot (CRR) pathogens associated with wheat (Triticum aestivum) in 91 fields in Montana were determined during the 2008 and 2009 crop seasons using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and conventional isolation methods. Correlations (P {\textless} 0.001) were found between detection methods for both diseases. FCR was detected in 57{\%} of the fields and CRR was detected in 93{\%} of the fields surveyed. Percent incidence based on isolation from individual tillers was Bipolaris sorokiniana (15{\%}), F. culmorum (13{\%}), and F. pseudograminearum (8{\%}). FCR populations were highly variable across the regions and were not detected in any fields from the Gb5 soil types of Judith Basin and Fergus counties. The spatial distributions of FCR and CRR were affected by elevation, soil type, and temperature. High FCR populations were associated with spring wheat crops rather than winter wheat based on qPCR (P {\textless} 0.001). FCR and CRR could produce yield losses in a range of 3 to 35{\%}. This study is the first time that qPCR was used to survey these two pathogen groups, and the merits and weakness of qPCR relative to traditional isolation methods are discussed.},

abstract = {Fusarium head blight (FHB) is an important disease of wheat worldwide caused mainly by Fusarium graminearum (syn. Gibberella zeae). This fungus can be highly aggressive and can produce several mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON), a well known harmful metabolite for humans, animals, and plants. The fungus can survive overwinter on wheat residues and on the soil, and can usually attack the wheat plant at their point of flowering, being able to infect the heads and to contaminate the kernels at the maturity. Contaminated kernels can be sometimes used as seeds for the cultivation of the following year. Poor knowledge on the ability of the strains of F. graminearum occurring on wheat seeds to be transmitted to the plant and to contribute to the final DON contamination of kernels is available. Therefore, this study had the goals of evaluating: (a) the capability of F. graminearum causing FHB of wheat to be transmitted from the seeds or soil to the kernels at maturity and the progress of the fungus within the plant at different growth stages; (b) the levels of DON contamination in both plant tissues and kernels. The study has been carried out for two years in a climatic chamber. The F. gramineraum strain selected for the inoculation was followed within the plant by using Vegetative Compatibility technique, and quantified by Real-Time PCR. Chemical analyses of DON were carried out by using immunoaffinity cleanup and HPLC/UV/DAD. The study showed that F. graminearum originated from seeds or soil can grow systemically in the plant tissues, with the exception of kernels and heads. There seems to be a barrier that inhibits the colonization of the heads by the fungus. High levels of DON and F. graminearum were found in crowns, stems, and straw, whereas low levels of DON and no detectable levels of F. graminearum were found in both heads and kernels. Finally, in all parts of the plant (heads, crowns, and stems at milk and vitreous ripening stages, and straw at vitreous ripening), also the accumulation of significant quantities of DON-3-glucoside (DON-3G), a product of DON glycosylation, was detected, with decreasing levels in straw, crown, stems and kernels. The presence of DON and DON-3G in heads and kernels without the occurrence of F. graminearum may be explained by their water solubility that could facilitate their translocation from stem  to heads and kernels. The presence of DON-3G at levels 23 times higher than DON in the heads at milk stage without the occurrence of F. graminearum may indicate that an active glycosylation of DON also occurs in the head tissues. Finally, the high levels of DON accumulated in straws are worrisome since they represent additional sources of mycotoxin for livestock. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Ascochyta blight is a serious disease affecting field peas. In France, disease management relies mainly on scheduled chemical applications without taking into account the actual disease risk. A better understanding of the factors affecting disease onset would therefore help in the timing of the first application. Field experiments involving eight sowing dates between mid-September and mid-December were conducted for two consecutive years. The seasonal dynamics of airborne inoculum were inves- tigated through trap plants. The weekly availability of airborne primary inoculum was extremely low during autumn and winter and was partially influenced by mesoclimatic conditions. Disease onset occurred between mid-October and early March depending on the sowing date. Generally, the later the sowing date, the longer the period between sowing and disease onset. This was due to an increase in the period between sowing and emergence. Disease onset was observed 14–35 days after emergence. A disease onset model based on the calculation of weather-dependent daily infection values (DIVs) was established, assum- ing that disease onset occurs once the temperature and moisture requirements for incubation are met. Cumu- lative daily infection values (cDIVs) were determined by sowing date and experiment through addition of consecutive DIVs between emergence and disease onset. A frequency analysis of cDIVs was performed to determine the 10th and 90th percentiles of the distribution. An analysis of the observed and pre- dicted values showed that observed disease onset dates were almost always included in the forecast window defined by these two percentiles. This study is the first attempt to predict ascochyta blight onset in field peas and should contribute to development of a more rational fungicide application strategy.},

abstract = {Tan spot of wheat, caused by the fungus Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, is a destructive disease found in wheat-growing regions worldwide that can lead to serious yield losses. Changes in cultural practices have led to an increase in the severity and incidence of tan spot. Following infection, compatible races of the fungus elicit two distinct symptoms in differential wheat lines: tan necrosis and (extensive) chlorosis. Tan necrosis has been clearly demonstrated by several groups to result from the action of a protein toxin, Ptr ToxA. Wheat sensitivity to this toxin is conditioned by a single dominant gene. The chlorosis response may be more complex and appears to involve at least two other toxins, Ptr ToxB and Ptr ToxC, produced by different races of the fungus. Distinct genes apparently condition the reaction of wheat lines to each of these chlorosis-inducing toxins. This review concentrates on significant advances that have occurred during the past decade in the characterization of this disease interaction, ranging from the epidemiology and management of tan spot to molecular host-parasite interactions. Particular emphasis is placed on work describing fungal race differentiation, production of toxins and their importance in pathogenicity, and the genetics and physiology of host response to infection.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V. Azoxystrobin is a widely used systemic fungicide in the Northeast of China, but it is unclear how azoxystrobin impacts the soil microbiome. Thus, we studied the impact of azoxystrobin on the microbial community structure and function in Chinese Spodosols. Field soil that had never been exposed to azoxystrobin was amended in laboratory batch experiments with 0 mg kg-1, 2 mg kg-1, 25 mg kg-1 and 50 mg kg-1 of azoxystrobin. Four soil enzymes (urease, invertase, phosphatase and catalase) were monitored to assess the impact of azoxystrobin on carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling as well as the microbial activity. The results show that the urease, invertase, and phosphatase (hydrolytic enzymes) activities was inhibited by as little as 2 mg kg−1 of azoxystrobin after 35 days, whereas the catalase (oxidoreductase enzyme) activity was promoted by the same concentration in most cases. Biolog Ecoplate analysis indicated that the utilization of different carbon sources was inhibited by azoxystrobin. 16S rRNA sequencing showed the bacterial operational taxonomic unit richness and the Shannon index decreased with increasing azoxystrobin concentration. Relative abundances of Sphingomonas decreased while Amycolatopsis and Sphingomonas increased by addition of increasing levels of azoxystrobin. In conclusion, azoxystrobin application to Spodosols leads to reduced urease, invertase, and phosphatase activities, which can impact nutrient cycling and carbon utilization. Furthermore, azoxystrobin application changed the microbiome community structure.},

abstract = {Warming experiments are increasingly relied on to estimate plant responses to global climate change(1,2). For experiments to provide meaningful predictions of future responses, they should reflect the empirical record of responses to temperature variability and recent warming, including advances in the timing of flowering and leafing(3-5). We compared phenology (the timing of recurring life history events) in observational studies and warming experiments spanning four continents and 1,634 plant species using a common measure of temperature sensitivity (change in days per degree Celsius). We show that warming experiments underpredict advances in the timing of flowering and leafing by 8.5-fold and 4.0-fold, respectively, compared with long-term observations. For species that were common to both study types, the experimental results did not match the observational data in sign or magnitude. The observational data also showed that species that flower earliest in the spring have the highest temperature sensitivities, but this trend was not reflected in the experimental data. These significant mismatches seem to be unrelated to the study length or to the degree of manipulated warming in experiments. The discrepancy between experiments and observations, however, could arise from complex interactions among multiple drivers in the observational data, or it could arise from remediable artefacts in the experiments that result in lower irradiance and drier soils, thus dampening the phenological responses to manipulated warming. Our results introduce uncertainty into ecosystem models that are informed solely by experiments and suggest that responses to climate change that are predicted using such models should be re-evaluated.},

abstract = {The genome of Fusarium oxysporum (Fo) consists of a set of eleven ‘core' chromosomes, shared by most strains and responsible for housekeeping, and one or several accessory chromosomes. We sequenced a strain of Fo f.sp. radicis-cucumerinum (Forc) using PacBio SMRT sequencing. All but one of the core chromosomes were assembled into single contigs, and a chromosome that shows all the hallmarks of a pathogenicity chromosome comprised two contigs. A central part of this chromosome contains all identified candidate effector genes, including homologs of SIX6, SIX9, SIX11 and SIX 13. We show that SIX6 contributes to virulence of Forc. Through horizontal chromosome transfer (HCT) to a non-pathogenic strain, we also show that the accessory chromosome containing the SIX gene homologs is indeed a pathogenicity chromosome for cucurbit infection. Conversely, complete loss of virulence was observed in Forc016 strains that lost this chromosome. We conclude that also a non-wilt-inducing Fo pathogen relies on effector proteins for successful infection and that the Forc pathogenicity chromosome contains all the information necessary for causing root rot of cucurbits. Three out of nine HCT strains investigated have undergone large-scale chromosome alterations, reflecting the remarkable plasticity of Fo genomes.},

The designed primers recognized isolates of F. verticillioides and F. subglutinans that were obtained from maize seeds from several producing regions of Brazil but did not recognize other Fusarium spp. or other fungal genera that were either obtained from fungal collections or isolated from maize seeds. A multiplex PCR protocol was established to simultaneously detect the genomic DNA from F. verticillioides and F. subglutinans. This protocol could detect the DNA from these fungi growing in artificially or naturally infected maize seeds. Another multiplex reaction with a pair of primers developed in this work combined with a pre-existing pair of primers has allowed identifying F. subglutinans, F. konzum, and F. thapsinum. In addition, the identification of F. nygamai was also possible using a combination of two PCR reactions described in this work, and another described in the literature.},

Rolling circle amplification (RCA) is a molecular amplification method with the unique property of product localization. This report describes the application of RCA signal amplification for multiplexed, direct detection and quantitation of nucleic acid targets on planar glass and gel-coated microarrays. As few as 150 molecules bound to the surface of microarrays can be detected using RCA. Because of the linear kinetics of RCA, nucleic acid target molecules may be measured with a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude. Consequently, RCA is a promising technology for the direct measurement of nucleic acids on microarrays without the need for a potentially biasing preamplification step.},

abstract = {Despite the central role of quantitative PCR (qPCR) in the quantification of mRNA transcripts, most analyses of qPCR data are still delegated to the software that comes with the qPCR apparatus. This is especially true for the handling of the fluorescence baseline. This article shows that baseline estimation errors are directly reflected in the observed PCR efficiency values and are thus propagated exponentially in the estimated starting concentrations as well as ‘fold-difference' results. Because of the unknown origin and kinetics of the baseline fluorescence, the fluorescence values monitored in the initial cycles of the PCR reaction cannot be used to estimate a useful baseline value. An algorithm that estimates the baseline by reconstructing the log-linear phase downward from the early plateau phase of the PCR reaction was developed and shown to lead to very reproducible PCR efficiency values. PCR efficiency values were determined per sample by fitting a regression line to a subset of data points in the log-linear phase. The variability, as well as the bias, in qPCR results was significantly reduced when the mean of these PCR efficiencies per amplicon was used in the calculation of an estimate of the starting concentration per sample.},

abstract = {High levels of inheritable resistance to phosphine in Rhyzopertha dominica have recently been detected in Australia and in an effort to isolate the genes responsible for resistance we have used random amplified DNA fingerprinting (RAF) to produce a genetic linkage map of R. dominica. The map consists of 94 dominant DNA markers with an average distance between markers of 4.6 cM and defines nine linkage groups with a total recombination distance of 390.1 cM. We have identified two loci that are responsible for high-level resistance. One provides approximately 50x resistance to phosphine while the other provides 12.5x resistance and in combination, the two genes act synergistically to provide a resistance level 250x greater than that of fully susceptible beetles. The haploid genome size has been determined to be 4.76 x 10(8) bp, resulting in an average physical distance of 1.2 Mbp per map unit. No recombination has been observed between either of the two resistance loci and their adjacent DNA markers in a population of 44 fully resistant F5 individuals, which indicates that the genes are likely to reside within 0.91 cM (1.1 Mbp) of the DNA markers.},

abstract = {Oxidative respiration is strongly temperature driven. However, in woody stems, efflux of CO2 to the atmosphere (E-A), commonly used to estimate the rate of respiration (R-S), and stem temperature (T-st) have often been poorly correlated, which we hypothesized was due to transport of respired CO2 in xylem sap, especially under high rates of sap flow (f(s)). To test this, we measured E-A, T-st, f(s) and xylem sap CO2 concentrations ([CO2*]) in 3-year-old Populus deltoides trees under different weather conditions (sunny and rainy days) in autumn. We also calculated R-S by mass balance as the sum of both outward and internal CO2 fluxes and hypothesized that R-S would correlate better with T-st than E-A. We found that E-A sometimes correlated well with T-st, but not on sunny mornings and afternoons or on rainy days. When the temperature effect on E-A was accounted for, a clear positive relationship between E-A and xylem [CO2*] was found. [CO2*] varied diurnally and increased substantially at night and during periods of rain. Changes in [CO2*] were related to changes in f(s) but not T-st. We conclude that changes in both respiration and internal CO2 transport altered E-A. The dominant component flux of R-S was E-A. However, on a 24-h basis, the internal transport flux represented 9-18{\%} and 3-7{\%} of R-S on sunny and rainy days, respectively, indicating that the contribution of stem respiration to forest C balance may be larger than previously estimated based on E (A) measurements. Unexpectedly, the relationship between R-S and T-st was sometimes weak in two of the three trees. We conclude that in addition to temperature, other factors such as water deficits or substrate availability exert control on the rate of stem respiration so that simple temperature functions are not sufficient to predict stem respiration.},

abstract = {Crop production is inherently sensitive to variability in climate. Temperature is a major determinant of the rate of plant development and, under climate change, warmer temperatures that shorten development stages of determinate crops will most probably reduce the yield of a given variety. Earlier crop flowering and maturity have been observed and documented in recent decades, and these are often associated with warmer (spring) temperatures. However, farm management practices have also changed and the attribution of observed changes in phenology to climate change per se is difficult. Increases in atmospheric [CO2] often advance the time of flowering by a few days, but measurements in FACE (free air CO2 enrichment) field-based experiments suggest that elevated [CO2] has little or no effect on the rate of development other than small advances in development associated with a warmer canopy temperature. The rate of development (inverse of the duration from sowing to flowering) is largely determined by responses to temperature and photoperiod, and the effects of temperature and of photoperiod at optimum and suboptimum temperatures can be quantified and predicted. However, responses to temperature, and more particularly photoperiod, at supraoptimal temperature are not well understood. Analysis of a comprehensive data set of time to tassel initiation in maize (Zea mays) with a wide range of photoperiods above and below the optimum suggests that photoperiod modulates the negative effects of temperature above the optimum. A simulation analysis of the effects of prescribed increases in temperature (0-6 degrees C in + 1 degrees C steps) and temperature variability (0{\%} and + 50{\%}) on days to tassel initiation showed that tassel initiation occurs later, and variability was increased, as the temperature exceeds the optimum in models both with and without photoperiod sensitivity. However, the inclusion of photoperiod sensitivity above the optimum temperature resulted in a higher apparent optimum temperature and less variability in the time of tassel initiation. Given the importance of changes in plant development for crop yield under climate change, the effects of photoperiod and temperature on development rates above the optimum temperature clearly merit further research, and some of the knowledge gaps are identified herein.},

Also characterized were 133 isolates that did not belong to any of the reported VCGs of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense including race 3 isolates from a Heliconia species and isolates from a symptomatic wild banana species growing in the jungle in peninsular Malaysia. The DNA fingerprint patterns were generally VCG specific, irrespective of geographic or host origin. A total of 33 different genotypes were identified within F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense; 19 genotypes were distinguished among the isolates that belonged to the 20 reported VCGs, and 14 new genotypes were identified among the isolates that did not belong to any of the existing VCGs. DNA fingerprinting analysis also allowed differentiation of nine clonal lineages within E oxysporum f. sp. cubense. Five of these lineages each contained numerous closely related VCGs and genotypes, and the remaining four lineages each contained a single genotype. The genetic diversity and geographic distribution of several of these lineages of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense suggests that they have coevolved with edible bananas and their wild diploid progenitors in Asia. DNA fingerprinting analysis of isolates from the wild pathosystem provides further evidence for the coevolution hypothesis. The genetic isolation and limited geographic distribution of four of the lineages of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense suggests that the pathogen has also arisen independently, both within and outside of the center of origin of the host.},

The availability of commercial imaging fluorimeters has helped make this technique available to the wider scientific community, but considerable care is needed, both in experimental design and in the interpretation of results, to make the most of this powerful analytical tool. The origins of changes in chlorophyll fluorescence yield are discussed and the use of conventional and novel combinatorial imaging approaches explored, together with complementary techniques such as thermal imaging. This review examines the use of chlorophyll fluorescence imaging as a method for the early detection of viral, bacterial and fungal infection, before symptoms are visible by eye, and also as a means with which to probe underlying pathogen-induced changes in host physiology in both compatible and incompatible interactions. The use of chlorophyll fluorescence imaging to study host physiology is greatly enhanced when the atmosphere around the leaf is manipulated and simultaneous measurements of gas exchange made: The cost to the host plant of different resistance mechanisms can be calculated, the fate of the products of photosynthetic electron transport determined and localised alterations in the source-sink status of host tissue visualised.},

abstract = {The impacts of climate change on ecosystem services are complex in the sense that effective prediction requires consideration of a wide range of factors. Useful analysis of climate-change impacts on crops and native plant systems will often require consideration of the wide array of other biota that interact with plants, including plant diseases, animal herbivores, and weeds. We present a framework for analysis of complexity in climate-change effects mediated by plant disease. This framework can support evaluation of the level of model complexity likely to be required for analysing climate-change impacts mediated by disease. Our analysis incorporates consideration of the following set of questions for a particular host, pathogen, host–pathogen combination, or geographic region. 1. Are multiple biological interactions important? 2. Are there environmental thresholds for population responses? 3. Are there indirect effects of global change factors on disease development? 4. Are spatial components of epidemic processes affected by climate? 5. Are there feedback loops for management? 6. Are networks for intervention technologies slower than epidemic networks? 7. Are there effects of plant disease on multiple ecosystem services? 8. Are there feedback loops from plant disease to climate change? Evaluation of these questions will help in gauging system complexity, as illustrated for fusarium head blight and potato late blight. In practice, it may be necessary to expand models to include more components, identify those components that are the most important, and synthesize such models to include the optimal level of complexity for planning and research prioritization.},
annote = {This review is highly focused on Modelling systems used to predict pathogen behaviour over time and space, with the main relation Climate change.

A common problem in scaling up the results of short-term empirical studies is the erroneous assumption that certain individual components of a system are equally important across all levels of integration (Rabbinge, 1989). In practice, the overall response of a system to variation in one of its components may average out over scenarios.

chronic yield losses to plant diseases (i.e. yield loss not attributable to acute or emerging disease problems) are estimated at over 10{\%} of rice yield in tropical Asia (Savary et al., 2006). The average global yield loss to disease is estimated at 16{\%} (Oerke, 2006). In multispecies systems such as plant disease, climate can affect each species individually, as well as influencing the interactions between species (e.g. Legre`ve{\&}Duveiller, 2010).

Our objective in this paper is to develop a framework for evaluation of complexity in the effects of climate change mediated by plant diseases.

An important component of the climate-disease interaction is mesoclimate and plant-growth effects on canopy microclimate (Monteith, 1972; Huber {\&}
Gillespie, 1992). Further, physiologically stressed plants often may be more susceptible to some diseases. Stressed plants may often be exposed to higher attack rates, either as a result of physical damage allowing access to pests, or as a result of physiological diversion of resources from defence to maintenance.

Diseases of rainfed crops, such as phytophthora blight (PB, caused by Phytophthora drechsleri f.sp. cajani) in pigeon pea and dry root rot in chickpea, can cause almost 100{\%} crop loss as a result of weather extremes associated with climate change (Pande et al., 2010). In the Deccan Plateau of India, the frequent resurgence of PB corresponds with changing rainfall patterns in the last decade (Sharma et al., 2006; Pande{\&}Sharma, 2009). When temperatures are between 24 and 28 C and rainfall {\textgreater}300 mm within a week during the crop season, PB can completely destroy the pigeon pea crop regardless of crop cultivar.

Typical disease forecasting models based on weather do not incorporate larger-scale processes or complexities that may lead to higher or lower levels of inoculum availability and pathogen dispersal (Seem, 2004).

Most forecasting tools are meant for tactical decisions within a season (e.g. Butt{\&}Jeger, 1985; Rossing, 1993), or at best for strategic short-term decisions (Esker et al., 2006); a priority now is to develop methodologies for strategic long-term decisions (e.g. Teng {\&} Savary, 1992) that are congruent with the unfolding consequences of climate change and other global change factors.

The translation of disease intensity into qualitative or quantitative crop losses is nonlinear and depends on a damage function (Zadoks, 1985). Addressing the consequences of epidemics on crop losses inevitably entails addressing injury mechanisms (Willocquet et al., 2004) and thus, also, host physiology (Ayres, 1981).

The greater the inherent system complexity, the lower the confidence in analyses based on simple models. Even when more complex models are used, confidence in predictors will still tend to be lower for complex systems than for truly simple systems because of the propagation of error associated with each model component.

A key challenge is to disentangle the direct contribution of climate change per se and its indirect effect through agricultural adaptation (Coakley et al., 1999). There are two dominant trends in adaptation: many farmers seek to reduce agricultural risks by enlarging the scale of operations and Intensifying production systems, whilst in alternative agricultural systems adaptation may be through the use of ecological buffering systems, including improved soil organic matter and water-holding capacity, minimizing potential drought effects (Lotter et al., 2003; Teasdale et al., 2007).

In many countries, daily records for temperature, humidity and precipitation, etc., are available at the local scale, and there are established methodologies available for estimating hourly values from daily values [cf. Parton {\&} Logan (1981) for temperature, and Eckersten (1986) for humidity] to provide crop disease models with input. For assessments on the regional scale there are methodologies available for interpolation between locations, regularly used by weather services, for example to replace missing data.

Another example of a potential increase in disease as a result of interactions of farming systems and climate change is the risk of wheat and barley fusarium head blight (FHB) as a consequence of the expansion of maize production (as may result from longer growing seasons), in particular when maize is grown in no-till systems

Conversion to reduced tillage systems as part of conservation agriculture programmes (Hobbs et al., 2008; Giller et al., 2009) may increase disease risk (Bockus{\&}Shroyer, 1998). For example, in wheat-based systems (providing the food base of nearly a billion people in South Asia), the expansion of conservation agriculture is expected to increase the incidence and severity of stubble- borne diseases such as tan spot and septoria leaf blotches (Savary et al., 1997;Duveiller et al., 2007).

Changes in policy may also influence the relationship between climate and disease. For example, Sweden and other European countries have previously implemented policies to reduce overproduction of wheat, such that a percentage of acreage should be under fallow not to be broken before 1 July. Fallow fields with volunteer wheat provided habitat for the leaf hopper Psammotettix alienus, which is a vector for Wheat dwarf virus (WDV) (Lindblad{\&}Waern, 2002).

Whilst the effects of climate change on weather will influence plant disease, these changes in weather are and will continue to cause shifts in cropping seasons and areas as well (e.g. Valdivia et al., 2010

However, because farmers may plant crops in areas or time periods so as to avoid disease (Thurston, 1990), crop growth models may misrepresent future growing seasons or areas because normally they model the optimal conditions for the crop and do not make allowances for disease or other
pests.

This asynchrony can lead to model outputs for disease risk that are out of sync with the time when crops are in the field and will be experiencing disease risk. Care must be taken when projecting the effects of climate change on plant disease to ensure that the temporal parameters for both the pathogen and the crop are congruent for more accurate results

Nonetheless, research into the potential effects of climate change on plant disease has often focused on development of disease in planta. This is in part because of the physical and biological complexity of inoculum dispersal processes (e.g. Aylor et al., 2001)

Survival of many types of pathogen propagules is dependent on the dose of solar radiation received (e.g. Mizubuti et al., 2000;Wuet al., 2002); therefore stronger winds and shorter travel times (or cloudier conditions) increase spore survival.

The effects of climate change can be exacerbated if there are feedback loops thatmake management less effective when pathogen populations increase. Feedback loops may occur when increases in disease make some types of management less efficient. Disease management that is based on reducing the amount of inoculum produced within a field is vulnerable to increased regional inoculum loads

Similarly, other methods that are based at least in part on controlling within-field inoculum production, such as field sanitation and many cases of intercropping and variety mixtures, may experience reduced efficacy when regional inoculum loads are high.

Because plant disease severity and incidence often increase following a compound interest model, a small increase in the length of the growing season can have a large impact on inoculumload. This in turn may influence the viability of many forms of disease management

The potential for patterns of pathogen evolution to change under climate change is another important consideration (Chakraborty {\&} Datta, 2003).

The effects of resistance genes can vary with temperature. For example, many rice bacterial blight resistance genes have less effect at higher temperatures, whilst one gene studied was more effective at higher temperatures (Webb et al., 2010).

Durability of resistance is more complex in changing environmental conditions, although in general, the types of pathogen life history traits that confer more rapid adaptation to host resistance (McDonald {\&} Linde, 2002) may also confer more rapid adaptation to climatic conditions.

Management that decreases yield losses to plant disease, in itself, can be considered a contribution to the global carbon budget, because less land must be maintained in or converted to agriculture for the same level of food production (Berry et al., 2008, 2010; Mahmuti et al., 2009). Hehehehe

As potato late blight moves into new territories, it has the potential to reduce diversity in wild potato species that were previously protected by low temperatures. Wild species may experience genetic bottlenecks or even extinction as a result of rapidly changing impacts from pathogen exposure.

Thirdly, higher disease levels may increase human consumption of mycotoxins and other unhealthy byproducts of plant disease. For example, elevated CO2 levels may increase fungal biomass of Fusarium pseudograminearum( Melloy et al., 2010), and thus also increase the potential for mycotoxin production

Intervention technologies are available for both FHB and LB, but not readily accessible by all farmers globally. FHB models have been developed and weather based risk evaluations made available online for some regions (De Wolf et al., 2003; http://www.wheatscab.psu.edu/).

Levin (2005) also discusses the role of system heterogeneity in supporting resilience, suggesting that agricultural systems are not complex adaptive systems, strictly speaking, because their simplified structures are determined exogenously rather than developing endogenously, leaving them highly vulnerable to problems such as diseases.

Multiple models – perhaps those designed to optimize precision, realism and generality – can be used simultaneously, to improve confidence in predictions when the predictions are similar and to reveal the potential need for more information when predictions diverge. In practice, two long-term phases of model development may be necessary. In the first phase, additional research will be used to parameterize larger and more detailed models. In the second phase, the larger models will be evaluated to determine which model components are less important and can be removed from models to support policy and prioritization.

Farmers who are resource-poor and economically vulnerable, with weak safety nets, are unlikely to take new risks.},

For typical sigmoid disease-progress curves, repeated assessments may be unnecessary. A mathematical procedure is derived for estimating the AUDPC from two data points. A field trial with ten cultivars with and without the gene Yr18 for resistance to stripe rust were inoculated with two pathotypes of Puccinia striiformis (from the cultivars Karamu and Oroua) and assessed for the percentage leaf area infected seven or eight times during the growing season. The AUDPCs were calculated directly from data and estimated from the described equation.

abstract = {ABSTRACT Rhizoctonia solani and R. oryzae are the principal causal agents of Rhizoctonia root rot in dryland cereal production systems of the Pacific Northwest. To facilitate the identification and quantification of these pathogens in agricultural samples, we developed SYBR Green I-based real-time quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) assays specific to internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and ITS2 of the nuclear ribosomal DNA of R. solani and R. oryzae. The assays were diagnostic for R. solani AG-2-1, AG-8, and AG-10, three genotypes of R. oryzae, and an AG-I-like binucleate Rhizoctonia species. Quantification was reproducible at or below a cycle threshold (Ct) of 33, or 2 to 10 fg of mycelial DNA from cultured fungi, 200 to 500 fg of pathogen DNA from root extracts, and 20 to 50 fg of pathogen DNA from soil extracts. However, pathogen DNA could be specifically detected in all types of extracts at about 100-fold below the quantification levels. Soils from Ritzville, WA, showing acute Rhizoctonia bare patch harbored 9.4 to 780 pg of R. solani AG-8 DNA per gram of soil.. Blastn, primer-template duplex stability, and phylogenetic analyses predicted that the Q-PCR assays will be diagnostic for isolates from Australia, Israel, Japan, and other countries.},

abstract = {Fusarium head blight (FHB) and crown rot (CR) are two wheat diseases caused by the same Fusarium pathogens. Progress towards CR resistance could benefit from FHB-resistant germplasm if the same genes are involved in resistance to these two different diseases. Two independent studies were conducted to investigate the relationship between host resistances to these two diseases. In the first study 32 genotypes were assessed and no significant correlation between their reactions to FHB and CR was detected. The second study was based on a QTL analysis of a doubled haploid population derived from a variety with resistance to both diseases. Results from this study showed that loci conferring resistance to FHB and CR are located on different chromosomes. Together, these results suggest that, despite a common aetiology, different host genes are involved in the resistance against FHB and CR in wheat. Thus, although it is possible that genes affecting both diseases may exist in other germplasm or under different conditions, separate screening seems to be needed in identifying sources of CR resistance.},

To investigate whether disease can alter the response of plants to CO2, we examined the effects of doubled CO2 (∼700 $\mu$mol mol−1) on Avena sativa infected with barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), a common pathogen of cereals and grasses. Oats infected with BYDV showed a significantly greater biomass response to CO2 enrichment than did healthy plants. Root mass of diseased plants increased by 37–60{\%} with CO2 enrichment, but was largely unaffected in healthy plants. CO2 enrichment increased midday leaf-level photosynthesis and instantaneous water use efficiency by 34 and 93{\%} in healthy plants and by 48 and 174{\%} in infected plants. Foliar carbohydrates increased with both CO2 enrichment and BYDV infection, but the two factors affected individual pools dissimilarly. CO2 enrichment may alter the epidemiology of BYDV by increasing the persistence of infected plants.},

The coding strand of the dsRNA was 13,023 nucleotides (nt) long (excluding the 3′ poly(A) tail) and was predicted to contain two discontiguous open reading frames (ORF A and ORF B). The 5′ proximal ORF A of 531nt encoded a protein of 176 amino acids (aa), and a BLAST search showed it to be similar to the putative papain-like protease domains encoded by Valsa ceratosperma hypovirus 1 (35{\%} identity) and Cryphonectria hypovirus 4 (CHV4) (31{\%} identity). The 3′ proximal ORF B of 11,118nt encoded a large polyprotein with three conserved domains, including papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA helicase domains. The polyprotein shared significant aa identities with CHV1 (32{\%}) and CHV2 (32{\%}). Both the genome organization and phylogenetic analysis suggested that the characterized RNA represented a novel hypovirus, designated “Fusarium graminearum hypovirus 1 (FgHV1)”, which was closely related to CHV1 and CHV2 in the Hypoviridae family. Elimination of the virus resulted in no dramatic phenotypic alteration of the fungus.},

Disease scores of an F2 population derived from the cross between a moderately resistant breeding line VC1210A and a susceptible wild relative (Vigna radiata var. sublobata, accession TC1966) showed a continuous distribution and was treated as a quantitative trait. Although no significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) that can explain the variation was detected by QTL analysis based on the reconstructed RFLP linkage map, new marker loci associated with resistance were discovered by AFLP analysis. The RFLP loci detected by two of the cloned AFLP bands are associated with resistance and constitute a new linkage group. A major resistance quantitative trait locus was found on this linkage group that accounted for 64.9{\%} of the variation in resistance to powdery mildew.

abstract = {Under drought prone conditions, wheat productivity is strongly related to photosynthetic activity and transpiration efficiency. In the present study, photosynthesis related traits were assessed at anthesis under rainfed and irrigated conditions on five durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) cultivars grown under Mediterranean conditions. Carbon isotope discrimination was also evaluated in flag leaf at anthesis (Delta L-a) and grain at maturity (Delta G(m)). Under rainfed conditions, highly significant correlations were found between both Delta L-a and Delta G(m), and leaf CO2 exchange rate (CER), stomatal conductance (g(s)) and internal to ambient CO2 concentration ratio (C-1/C-a). Delta G(m) was correlated negatively with transpiration efficiency (measured as CER/g(s)) under tainted conditions, and positively under irrigated conditions. Under both conditions, Delta G(m) was positively associated with grain yield. No significant correlation was observed between mesophyll conductance and CER. In contrast, the latter trait was positively related to g, under irrigated conditions suggesting that CER was driven by stomatal limitations. No correlation was found between Delta L-a. and grain yield. It is concluded that breeding for high Delta G(m) would lead, under Mediterranean drought conditions, to higher stomatal conductance, lower transpiration efficiency and higher grain yield.

abstract = {One of the major goals of the European Stress Physiology and Climate Experiment (ESPACE-wheat) was to investigate the sensitivity of wheat growth and productivity to the combined effects of changes in CO2 concentration, ozone and other physiological stresses. Experiments were performed at different sites throughout Europe, over three consecutive growing-seasons using open-top chambers. This paper summarizes the main experimental findings of the effects of CO2 enrichment and other factors i.e. ozone (O-3), drought stress or nitrogen supply on the biomass and yield of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Minaret). Final harvest data from different sites and seasons were statistically analysed: (1) to identify main effects and interactions between experimentally controlled factors; and (2) to evaluate quantitative relationships between environmental variables and biological responses. Generally, 'Minaret' wheat did not respond significantly to O-3, suggesting that this cultivar is relatively tolerant to the O-3 levels applied. The main effect of CO2 was a significant enhancement of grain yield and above-ground biomass in almost all experiments. Significant interactions between CO2 and other factors were not common, although modifications in different N- and water supplies also led to significant effects on grain yield and biomass. In addition, climatic factors (in particular: mean air temperature and global radiation) were identified as important co-variables affecting grain yield or biomass, respectively. On average, the yield increase as a result of a doubling of [CO2] was 35{\%} compared with that observed at ambient CO2 concentrations. However, linear regressions of grain yield or above-ground biomass for individual experiments revealed a large variability in the quantitative responses of 'Minaret' wheat to CO2 enrichment (yield increase ranging from 11 to 121{\%}). Hence, CO2 responsiveness was shown to differ considerably when the same cultivar of wheat was grown at different European locations. Multiple regression analyses performed to evaluate the relative importance of the measured environmental parameters on grain yield indicated that although yield was significantly related to five independent variables (24 h mean CO2 concentration, 12 h mean O-3 concentration, temperature, radiation, and drought stress), a large proportion of the observed variability remained unexplained.

abstract = {Fusarium crown rot (FCR) of wheat is a persistent problem that causes significant losses worldwide. In Montana, FCR is caused primarily by Fusarium culmorum and F pseudograminearum. Recently, a real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR) assay was developed for FCR using primers and probes specific for a segment of the trichodiene synthase (tri5) gene. The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of QPCR for accessing FCR severity on wheat in field experiments. In 2004 and 2005, plots of spring and durum wheat were inoculated with varying levels of F pseudograminearum oat inoculum and grown under rain-fed conditions. Two weeks prior to harvest, plants were collected from the plots and assessed for FCR severity and analyzed by QPCR for Fusarium DNA quantities. Disease severity scores (DSS) and Fusarium DNA quantities were positively correlated with each other for all three cultivars in 2004 but for only the durum cultivar in 2005 (P {\textless} 0.05). In 2004, grain yields for both spring wheat cultivars were negatively correlated with Fusarium DNA quantities (P {\textgreater} 0.05). When DSS and Fusarium DNA quantities negatively correlated with yield, both measurements were comparable in predicting yield reduction (R = -0.64 and -0.77, respectively). Results indicate that this QPCR assay is effective in measuring FCR severity in wheat.},

abstract = {The Fusarium mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) can cause cell death in wheat (Triticum aestivum), but can also reduce the level of cell death caused by heat shock in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cell cultures. We show that 10 mu g mL(-1) DON does not cause cell death in Arabidopsis cell cultures, and its ability to retard heat-induced cell death is light dependent. Under dark conditions, it actually promoted heat-induced cell death. Wheat cultivars differ in their ability to resist this toxin, and we investigated if the ability of wheat to mount defense responses was light dependent. We found no evidence that light affected the transcription of defense genes in DON-treated roots of seedlings of two wheat cultivars, namely cultivar CM82036 that is resistant to DON-induced bleaching of spikelet tissue and cultivar Remus that is not. However, DON treatment of roots led to genotype-dependent and light-enhanced defense transcript accumulation in coleoptiles. Wheat transcripts encoding a phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) gene (previously associated with Fusarium resistance), non-expressor of pathogenesis-related genes-1 (NPR1) and a class III plant peroxidase (POX) were DON-upregulated in coleoptiles of wheat cultivar CM82036 but not of cultivar Remus, and DON-upregulation of these transcripts in cultivar CM82036 was light enhanced. Light and genotype-dependent differences in the DON/DON derivative content of coleoptiles were also observed. These results, coupled with previous findings regarding the effect of DON on plants, show that light either directly or indirectly influences the plant defense responses to DON.},

abstract = {A simple model, G1 Blackspot Manager, has been developed to predict the seasonal pattern of release of ascospores in relation to ascochyta blight in field pea. The model considers a combination of two weather factors, daily mean temperature and daily total rainfall, to drive progress of maturity of pseudothecia on infested field pea stubble from past crops. Each day is categorised as suitable or not suitable for continuation of the maturation process. The onset of pseudothecial maturity has been found to take place when approximately ten suitable days have occurred. Following the onset of maturity, ascospore release is triggered when daily rainfall exceeds a threshold. The model was satisfactorily calibrated using three datasets from Western Australia. The calibrated model performed well when independently tested with 21 datasets, 17 from Western Australia and 4 from South Australia. It is concluded that G1 Blackspot Manager model has the potential to be used to formulate sowing guides for field pea in southern Australia that minimise the risk of ascochyta blight.},

abstract = {The effect of climate change on the temporal and regional occurrence of Cercospora leaf spot (CLS) of sugar beet in Lower Saxony is analysed using the forecasting model CERCBET1. Based on the hourly weather parameters temperature and relative humidity, this model predicts three events: the time when 1{\%}, 50{\%} and 100{\%} of the fields in a region are infested (T1, T50 and T100). Input data are the results of the regional climate model REMO. The effects of climate change are studied in three time windows: a baseline period B (1971-2000), a medium-term period M (2021-2050) and a long-term period L (2071-2100). A comparison of the time windows B and M shows that T1 has an earlier occurrence by 5.2 days, T50 by 6.7 days and T100 by 10.6 days. In period L, T1 is reached 22.9 days earlier than in period B; the occurrence of T50 and TWO is 25.2 and 32.7 days earlier. For a regional risk analysis, Lower Saxony is subdivided into four interpolation areas. In all three time windows, in every season the epidemic starts in the west and ends in the north, while the east and the south are consistently in the middle of the timeline. One consequence of the earlier occurrence could be an increase of the frequency of fungicide application but from today's perspective the consequences are hardly predictable due to the lack of knowledge about multiple interactions between host and pathogen and the social-economic developments in the future.},

A newly defined spectral index, relative adsorptive index in the 2000-2300 nm region (RAI(2000-2300)), which can be calculated by RAI(2000-2300) = (R-2224 - R-2054) (R-2224 + R-2054)(-1) with R being the reflectance at 2224 or 2054 nm, was utilized. This spectral index, RAI(2000-2300), was significantly correlated (P {\textless} 0.01) with green LAI and leaf N concentration and proved to be potentially valuable for monitoring plant green LAI and leaf N at the field canopy scale. Moreover, plant LAI could be monitored more easily and more successfully than plant leaf N. The study also showed that leaf water had a strong masking effect on the 2000-2300 nm spectral characteristics and both the coefficient between RAI(2000-2300) and green LAI and that between RAI(2000-2300) and leaf N content decreased as leaf water content increased.},

Population dynamics between Fusarium pseudograminearum and Bipolaris sorokiniana in wheat stems using real-time qPCR. Plant Dis. 95:1089-1098. Fusarium pseudograminearum and Bipolaris sorokiniana are causal agents of Fusarium crown rot and common root rot, respectively, of wheat and cause significant losses worldwide. Understanding the population dynamics between these two pathogens at late stages of wheat development is needed. The effect of E pseudograminearum and B. sorokiniana inocula applied singly or in mixtures at seeding to spring wheat 'Hank' was measured using seedling stand, grain yield, and pathogen populations in the first internode at heading, milk, and harvest stage of wheat development using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. High and low rates of E pseudograminearum inoculum reduced B. sorokiniana populations in field trials but B. sorokiniana inoculations did not affect F pseudograminearum populations. Populations of both pathogens increased front heading until harvest, with E psendograminearum colonizing lower internodes earlier than B. sorokiniana. Neither pathogen prevented infection by the other in the first internode of wheat stems. Inoculations increased incidence of infection and co-infection relative to natural settings observed for both pathogens. At the seedling stage, both fungi, individually or combined, reduced the seedling stands when compared with a non-inoculated control for the three location years. Grain yield and E pseudograminearum populations were inversely correlated, while B. sorokiniana populations were not correlated with yield.},

abstract = {Rhizoctonia oryzae and R. solani anastomosis group (AG)-8 both cause root rot of wheat and barley, but R. oryzae has been considered secondary in importance to R. solani AG-8 on these cereals in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Of 19 isolates of R. oryzae, 12 caused both preemergence damping-off of wheat and a significant reduction in root biomass of 21-day-old seedlings in natural soil at 12 degrees C, whereas 7 isolates induced minimal or no damage to wheat under these growth conditions. R. solani AG-8 had no effect on seedling emergence and seminal root development, but four of eight isolates tested caused severe root rot of wheat. Thus, R. oryzae and R. solani AG-8 may cause distinctive and different damage as pathogens of wheat, and their relative importance may vary among field sites and with the developmental stage of the host plant. The nucleotide sequence of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions was divergent between the two species; therefore, the oligonucleotide primers RO1 and RO2 were developed from sequences within ITS1 and ITS2, respectively, that are unique to R. oryzae. These primers amplified a 511-bp fragment from DNA of R. oryzae but not DNA from any intraspecific group of R. solani or from binucleate Rhizoctonia spp. A polymerase chain reaction protocol with the RO1 and RO2 primer set was used to detect R. oryzae in wheat roots and is a suitable method to diagnose this fungus.},

abstract = {Caused by a complex of Fusarium species including F. culmorum, F. graminearum, and F. pseudograminearum, Fusarium crown rot (FCR) is an important cereal disease worldwide. For this study, Fusarium population dynamics were examined in spring wheat residues sampled from dryland field locations near Bozeman and Huntley, MT, using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) Taqman assay that detects F. culmorum, F. graminearum, and F. pseudograminearum. Between August 2005 and June 2007, Fusarium populations and residue decomposition were measured eight times for standing stubble (0 to 20 cm above the soil surface), lower stem (20 to 38 cm), middle stem (38 to 66 cm), and chaff residues. Large Fusarium populations were found in stubble collected in August 2005 from F. pseudograminearum-inoculated plots. These populations declined rapidly over the next 8 months. Remnant Fusarium populations in inoculated stubble were stable relative to residue biomass from April 2006 until June 2007. These two phases of population dynamics were observed at both locations. Relative to inoculated stubble populations, Fusarium populations in other residue fractions and from noninoculated plots were small. In no case were FCR species observed aggressively colonizing noninfested residues based on qPCR data. These results suggest that Fusarium populations are unstable in the first few months after harvest and do not expand into noninfested wheat residues. Fusarium populations remaining after 8 months were stable for at least another 14 months in standing stubble providing significant inoculums for newly sown crops.},

This paper quantifies the amount of plant biomass and fusarium biomass between two different cultivars "Outlook and "Choteau" at two locations "Huntley” and “Bozeman”. Hogg samples from different sections of the plants Stubble, lower stem, upper stem and charff and compares the differences over time after the cropping season. effectivley showing the rate of stubble and innoculumn degredation which is assumed to be correllated.

Pereyra et al. (28) examined the survival of F. graminearum on decomposing wheat residues that were either buried or left on the soil surface using culturing techniques. F. graminearum colonization decreased over time in direct relationship to residue decomposition. After 2 years, buried stem residues were 99{\%} degraded while surface residues were 75{\%} degraded. Recovery of F. graminearum from buried residues was half that of surface 
residues.

This Taqman assay, based on the trichodiene synthase gene (tri5), specifically detects the three primary FCR species in Montana, F. culmorum, F. graminearum, and F. pseudograminearum. To monitor inhibition in the qPCR reactions (11), all undiluted DNA samples were spiked with 335 pg of plasmid containing the $\beta$-actin gene (mjba-1) from Meloidogyne javanica (26).

The primary goal was to establish baseline population dynamicsfor FCR pathogens in wheat residues under conditions typical ofMontana's wheat production systems using a previously developed qPCR assay (15,40). Additionally, this study provided an initial assessment of colonization of uninfested residues by FCR species during noncropping periods and the impacts that recently adopted solid-stem cultivars used for controlling wheat stem sawfly (Cephus cinctus) may have on Fusarium survival

Cultivars also did not differ in total biomass for noninoculated or inoculated plots.
Outlook had a higher percentage than Choteau for the middle stem fraction in noninoculated plots (21.5{\%} versus 19.5{\%}, respectively; P = 0.0396) and inoculated plots (23{\%} versus 21{\%}, respectively; P 
There was no difference in Fusarium populations between the two cultivars for either inoculated or noninoculated plots. [ Therefore I assume there would be no difference between isolates having cultivar preferance,,,,, however the technique to determine isolate difference should be checked ]

Fusarium populations in inoculated stubble residues at both Bozeman (P 
over two locations and 22 months of this study, therewas no significant saprophytic colonization of residues bydetectable members of the FCR complex as Fusarium populationsremained low throughout. Thus, residue fractions, if not colonizedpathogenically, do not appear to act as a resource base for populationexpansion.

Therefore there is no evidence that solid stemsact as better reservoirs for FCR species through noncroppingcycles.

Studies by others have shown that FCR development is the resultof high spring moisture followed by low late season moisture.Bottlenecks in either spring or late season conditions can dramaticallyeffect disease development (4,6). [ i.e. a wet start to the season followed by a dry finish to the growing season is condusive to high CR disease index]},

abstract = {Most reviews of climate change are epidemiological, focusing on impact assessment and risk mapping. However, there are many reports of the effects of environmental stress factors on defense mechanisms in plants against pathogens. We review those representative of key climate change-related stresses to determine whether there are any patterns or trends in adaptation responses. We recognize the complexity of climate change itself and the multitrophic nature of the complex biological interactions of plants, microbes, soil, and the environment and, therefore, the difficulty of reductionist dissection approaches to resolving the problems. We review host defense genes, germplasm, and environmental interactions in different types of organisms but find no significant group-specific trends. Similarly, we review by host defense mechanism type and by host pathogen trophic relationship but identify no dominating mechanism for stress response. However, we do identify core stress response mechanisms playing key roles in multiple response pathways whether to biotic or abiotic stress. We suggest that these should be central to mechanistic climate change plant defense research. We also recognize biodiversity, heterogeneity, and the need for understanding stress in a true systems biology approach as being essential components of progressing our understanding of and response to climate change.},

A 3-year survey was conducted covering most cropping regions in Western Australia, utilizing PreDicta B to determine soilborne pathogen levels and visual assessments to score root health and incidence of individual crop root diseases caused by the major root pathogens, including Rhizoctonia solani (anastomosis group [AG]-8), Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (take-all), Fusarium pseudograminearum, and Pratylenchus spp. (root-lesion nematodes) on wheat roots for 115, 50, and 94 fields during 2010,...},

abstract = {Atmospheric CO2 concentrations are predicted to double within the next century and alter climate regimes, yet the extent that these changes will affect plant diseases remains unclear. In this study conducted over five years, we assessed how elevated CO2 and interannual climatic variability affect Cercospora leaf spot diseases of two deciduous trees. Climatic data varied considerably between the five years and altered disease expression. Disease incidence and severity for both species were greater in years with above average rainfall. in years with above average temperatures, disease incidence for Liquidambar styraciflua was decreased significantly. When significant changes did occur, disease incidence and severity always increased under elevated CO2. Chlorophyll fluorescence imaging of leaves revealed that any visible increase in disease severity induced by elevated CO2 was mitigated by higher photosynthetic efficiency in the remaining undamaged leaf tissue and in a halo surrounding lesions.

abstract = {Heterotrimeric G proteins are involved in the defense response against necrotrophic fungi in Arabidopsis. In order to elucidate the resistance mechanisms involving heterotrimeric G proteins, we analyzed the effects of the G beta (subunit deficiency in the mutant agb1-2 on pathogenesis-related gene expression, as well as the genetic interaction between agb1-2 and a number of mutants of established defense pathways. G beta-mediated signaling suppresses the induction of salicylic acid (SA)-, jasmonic acid (JA)-, ethylene (ET)- and abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent genes during the initial phase of the infection with Fusarium oxysporum (up to 48 h after inoculation). However, at a later phase it enhances JA/ET-dependent genes such as PDF1.2 and PR4. Quantification of the Fusarium wilt symptoms revealed that G beta- and SA-deficient mutants were more susceptible than wild-type plants, whereas JA- and ET-insensitive and ABA-deficient mutants demonstrated various levels of resistance. Analysis of the double mutants showed that the G beta-mediated resistance to F. oxysporum and Alternaria brassicicola was mostly independent of all of the previously mentioned pathways. However, the progressive decay of agb1-2 mutants was compensated by coi1-21 and jin1-9 mutations, suggesting that at this stage of F. oxysporum infection G beta acts upstream of COI1 and ATMYC2 in JA signaling.},

abstract = {The morphology of two soil-borne Verticillium species, V. dahliae and V. tricorpus, was studied on two semi-selective agar media, in the absence and presence of soil. Morphology of the fungi differed considerably between the media, with respect to presence and shape of microsclerotia, dark hyphae (i.e. short melanised hyphae attached to the microsclerotia) and dark mycelium (i.e. melanised mycelium throughout the colony). On modified soil extract agar (MSEA), a pectate based agar, V. dahliae always had globose to elongate microsclerotia, without dark hyphae or dark mycelium, whereas V. tricorpus always had dark hyphae or dark mycelium, and microsclerotia, whenever present, were globose to irregular in shape. On ethanol agar (EA), V. dahliae had large microsclerotia and abundant dark hyphae, whereas V. tricorpus did not form microsclerotia, but always abundant dark mycelium. For the first time we observed the formation of dark hyphae by V. dahliae to a great extent. In the presence of soil, most characteristics were less pronounced, and V. dahliae microsclerotia were smaller, but V. tricorpus produced large microsclerotia, even when they were absent in pure culture. Morphological characteristics suitable for discrimination between the two species on MSEA plates in the presence of soil were selected and tested with fresh isolates from agricultural fields. The two fungi could be distinguished using qualitative characteristics and microsclerotial size. Molecular analysis and morphology on potato dextrose agar confirmed all identifications made on soil dilution plates.},

The protocol integrates steel pellet tissue homogenization and unique liquid handling and phase separation techniques with minimal special equipment. The method was validated for difficult plant DNAs, such as hop (Humulus lupulus L.), soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.], and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.), with agarose gel separations of restriction fragments and Southern blot analysis of transgene integrants in soybean. The range of success rates for Southern blots was 73 to 92{\%} per sample per plate (n = 2016 samples). Variation in absolute yield was quantified by PicoGreen microplate flourimetry. The variation in yield among samples per plate was small enough to obviate individual sample concentration adjustment before Southern analysis. Average absolute yield for the barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) mapping population based on flourimetry was 6.8 mu g +/- 0.85 SE, n = 96; providing enough pure, stable DNA for many individual polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reactions. Intersample cross-contamination and suitability for PCR analysis were validated by simple sequence repeat (SSR) display of a previously characterized barley mapping population. Cost calculation from a materials detail was U.S. {\$}0.17 per sample extraction. Although the implementation requires some skill and practice, we rind it to be a robust, adaptable, and versatile alternative to expensive commercial kits.},

abstract = {Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, causal agent of tan spot of wheat, produces a cultivar-specific toxin (Ptr ToxA) required for high virulence. Sensitive wheat lines develop necrosis within 48 h of infiltration with nM levels of purified toxin, but the mechanism by which this occurs is not understood. The involvement of wheat metabolism in the action of Ptr ToxA was investigated here with a qualitative assay based on necrosis development and a more rapid and quantitative assay based on electrolyte leakage. Necrosis and electrolyte leakage failed to develop when toxin-treated wheat was incubated at 4 degrees C, but the inhibition of toxin action by cold was reversible. Necrosis developed when wheat was exposed to toxin for 8 h at 4 degrees C, then shifted to 20 degrees C for an additional 40 h. Electrolyte leakage was delayed by only 2 h in toxin-treated leaves held at 4 degrees C for 6 h then shifted to 20 degrees C, relative to leaves held at 20 degrees C throughout. Toxin-induced electrolyte leakage was reduced by the co-application of sodium vanadate, an inhibitor of H+-ATPases. However, the level of protection from electrolyte leakage by a single application of vanadate decreased as time increased, and the inhibitor failed to prevent necrosis development. Inhibitors of transcription (alpha-amanitin and cordycepin) and of translation (cycloheximide) each reduced the level of toxin-induced electrolyte leakage. Cycloheximide was the only inhibitor that prevented necrosis development when cc-infiltrated with toxin. The data indicate that the action of Ptr ToxA requires active host processes including transcription, translation, and functional H+-ATPases. (C) 1998 Academic Press.},

abstract = {While many studies have demonstrated the sensitivities of plants and of crop yield to a changing climate, a major challenge for the agricultural research community is to relate these findings to the broader societal concern with food security. This paper reviews the direct effects of climate on both crop growth and yield and on plant pests and pathogens and the interactions that may occur between crops, pests, and pathogens under changed climate. Finally, we consider the contribution that better understanding of the roles of pests and pathogens in crop production systems might make to enhanced food security. Evidence for the measured climate change on crops and their associated pests and pathogens is starting to be documented. Globally atmospheric [CO2] has increased, and in northern latitudes mean temperature at many locations has increased by about 1.0-1.4C with accompanying changes in pest and pathogen incidence and to farming practices. Many pests and pathogens exhibit considerable capacity for generating, recombining, and selecting fit combinations of variants in key pathogenicity, fitness, and aggressiveness traits that there is little doubt that any new opportunities resulting from climate change will be exploited by them. However, the interactions between crops and pests and pathogens are complex and poorly understood in the context of climate change. More mechanistic inclusion of pests and pathogen effects in crop models would lead to more realistic predictions of crop production on a regional scale and thereby assist in the development of more robust regional food security policies.},

Consequently, increased efforts worldwide have been undertaken to develop integrated pest management (IPM) programs, principally based on manipulation of its natural enemies. Although over 130 parasitoid species are known to attack various life stages of DBM, most control worldwide is achieved by relatively few hymenopteran species belonging to the ichneumonid genera Diadegma and Diadromus, the braconid genera Microplitis and Cotesia, and the eulophid genus Oomyzus. DBM populations native to different regions have genetic and biological differences, and specific parasitoid strains may be associated with the specific DBM strains. Therefore, accurate identification based on genetic studies of both host and parasitoid is of crucial importance to attaining successful control of DBM through inoculative or inundative releases. Although parasitoids of DBM larvae and pupae are currently its principal regulators, bacteria-derived products ( e. g., crystal toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis) and myco-insecticides principally based on Zoophthora radicans and Beauveria bassiana are increasingly being applied or investigated for biological control. Viruses, nematodes and microsporidia also have potential as biopesticides for DBM. When an insect pest is exposed to more than one mortality factor, there is the possibility of interactions that can enhance, limit, or limit and enhance the various aspects of effectiveness of a particular control tactic. This paper reviews the effectiveness of various parasitoids and entomopathogens against DBM, interactions among them, and their possible integration into modern IPM programs.},

abstract = {The interplay of host and pathogen life history traits with disease epidemiology and the selective pressures exerted on hosts drives genetic change and the long-term coevolutionary trajectories of host-pathogen associations. Many studies have addressed various aspects of the ways in which hosts and their pathogens interact but have tended to focus on individual populations, on comparisons made at single points in time, or on broader comparisons that confound patterns from different epidemiological and evolutionary units. While such studies provide valuable information, their essentially 'static' snap-shot nature limits the ability to interpret the nature of the underpinning coevolutionary processes. An increasing number of long-term studies involving repeat sampling of multiple interaction demes distributed across space are giving insight into the complexity of the numerical and genetic dynamics of host and pathogen interactions. These illustrate: (a) the ephemerality of disease in individual populations in contrast to its predictability at the metapopulation scale; (b) the spatial and temporal dynamics of selection 'hot-spots', rates of extinction and recolonization; and (c) differences in coevolutionary dynamics among demes within a metapopulation. Such long-term studies further emphasise the interplay between life history traits, time and space, and the importance of developing a framework to classify the seemingly daunting diversity of host-pathogen associations. {\textcopyright} 2013 UK Crown.},

The underlying cause of most plant EIDs is the anthropogenic introduction of parasites, although severe weather events are also important drivers of disease emergence. Much is known about crop plant EIDs, but there is little information about wild-plant EIDs, suggesting that their impact on conservation is underestimated.

Under day/night temperatures of 25/25, 27/27 and 30/25°C for 20 and 25 days, the D-pathotype isolates induced the defoliation syndrome on seedlings of the two upland cotton cultivars, whereas the ND-pathotype isolates did not induce defoliation syndrome. The values for the areas under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) and the vascular discoloration index (VDI) were higher for the D-pathotype isolates than those for the ND-pathotype isolates in each temperature treatment. Under 30/30 or 33/27°C, at least two of the three D-pathotype isolates still had higher AUDPC values and/or VDI values than all the ND-pathotype isolates on E Mian 24. Therefore, the D-pathotype isolates appear more aggressive than the ND-pathotype isolates in infection of cotton. Results also showed that the cotton cultivar Yin Rui 361 was more tolerant than the cotton cultivar E Mian 24 to infection by both pathotypes of V. dahliae. This study suggests that the D-pathotype isolates can well adapt to high temperature and heavily infect cotton under 25-30°C, and these features might be responsible for the rapid spread of this pathotype in central China. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science + Business Media B.V.},

In each case, specialist and generalist pathogens (defined here as infecting one versus multiple species within a focal host community) are seen to produce contrasting dynamics. This community-level framework for plant-pathogen interactions is extended to include other species in the biotic community such as herbivores and microbial symbionts. Specifically, plant-pathogen interactions can be modified by competing plant species, reservoir plant species, microbial symbionts of plants and herbivores. The potential of interaction of parasitism, competition, mutualism and herbivory in ecological communities and the approaches that integrated these interactions are discussed.},

abstract = {The diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (L.), remains a major pest of brassica crops worldwide. DBM has been estimated globally to cost US{\$} 1 billion in direct losses and control costs. Chemical control of this pest remains difficult due to the rapid development of resistance to insecticides and to their effect on natural enemies. These problems are especially severe in South Asia and Africa where lack of knowledge, limited access to newer and safer insecticides, and a favourable climate result in DBM remaining a serious year-round pest which substantially increases the cost and uncertainty of crop production. Despite these problems, application of synthetic insecticides remains overwhelmingly the most common control strategy. Biologically-based efforts to control DBM in Africa and Asia have focused strongly on parasitoid introductions. However, despite the identification and deployment of promising parasitoids in many regions, these efforts have had limited impact, often because farmers continue early-season spraying of broad-spectrum insecticides that are lethal to parasitoids and thus exacerbate DBM outbreaks. A significant driver for this pattern of insecticide use is the presence of aphids and other pests whose appearance initiates inappropriate spraying. Despite often extensive training of producers in farmer field schools, many growers seem loath to discard calendar or prophylactic spraying of insecticides. The introduction of an IPM technology that could replace the use of broad-spectrum insecticides for DBM and other key Lepidoptera is crucial if the benefits of parasitoid introduction are to be fully realised. The deployment of DBM-resistant brassicas expressing proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis could help to break this cycle of insecticide misuse and crop loss, but their deployment should be part of an integrated pest management (IPM) package, which recognises the constraints of farmers while addressing the requirement to control other Lepidoptera, aphids and other secondary pests. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The strong trends in climate change already evident, the likelihood of further changes occurring, and the increasing scale of potential climate impacts give urgency to addressing agricultural adaptation more coherently. There are many potential adaptation options available for marginal change of existing agricultural systems, often variations of existing climate risk management. We show that implementation of these options is likely to have substantial benefits under moderate climate change for some cropping systems. However, there are limits to their effectiveness under more severe climate changes. Hence, more systemic changes in resource allocation need to be considered, such as targeted diversification of production systems and livelihoods. We argue that achieving increased adaptation action will necessitate integration of climate change-related issues with other risk factors, such as climate variability and market risk, and with other policy domains, such as sustainable development. Dealing with the many barriers to effective adaptation will require a comprehensive and dynamic policy approach covering a range of scales and issues, for example, from the understanding by farmers of change in risk profiles to the establishment of efficient markets that facilitate response strategies. Science, too, has to adapt. Multidisciplinary problems require multidisciplinary solutions, i.e., a focus on integrated rather than disciplinary science and a strengthening of the interface with decision makers. A crucial component of this approach is the implementation of adaptation assessment frameworks that are relevant, robust, and easily operated by all stakeholders, practitioners, policymakers, and scientists. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

The development of a molecular diagnostic capable of reliably distinguishing between the various races of the pathogen is of key importance to disease management. However, attempts to distinguish isolates using the standard molecular loci typically used for fungal phylogenetics have been complicated by a poor correlation between phylogeny and pathogenicity. Among the available alternative loci are several putative effector genes, known as SIX genes, which have been successfully used to differentiate the three races of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. In this study, an international collection of Foc isolates was screened for the presence of the putative effector SIX8. Using a PCR and sequencing approach, variation in Foc-SIX8 was identified which allowed race 4 to be differentiated from race 1 and 2 isolates, and tropical and subtropical race 4 isolates to be distinguished from one another.},

abstract = {Climate change will include correlated increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration (C(a)). Rising temperatures will increase the ratio of photorespiratory loss of carbon to photosynthetic gain, whilst rising C(a) will have an opposing effect. The mechanism of these effects at the level of carboxylation in C3 photosynthesis are quantitatively well understood and provide a basis for models of the response of leaf and canopy carbon exchange to climate change. The principles of such a model are referred to here and used to quantitatively examine the implications of concurrent increase in temperature and C(a). Simulations of leaf photosynthesis show the increase, with elevation of C(a) from 350 to 650-mu-mol mol-1, in light saturated rates of CO2 uptake (A(sat)) and maximum quantum yields (phi) to rise with temperature. An increase in C(a) from 350 to 650-mu-mol mol-1 can increase A(sat) by 20{\%} at 10-degrees-C and by 105{\%} at 35-degrees-C, and can raise the temperature optimum of A(sat) by 5-degrees-C. This pattern of change agrees closely with experimental data. At the canopy level, simulations also suggest a strong interaction of increased temperature and CO2 concentration. Predictions are compared with the findings of long-term field studies. The principles used here suggest that elevated C(a) will alter both the magnitude of the response of leaf and canopy carbon gain to rising temperature, and sometimes, the direction of response. Findings question the value of models for predicting plant production in response to climate change which ignore the direct effects of rising C(a) and the modifications that rising C(a) imposes on the temperature response of net CO2 exchange.},

The duration of ascospore release was longer in England, where winter weather is mild and wet, than in Poland, where winters are cold and often with snow cover, but there was little difference between two sites in England (Rothamsted and Boxworth). Wetness provided by rainfall was essential for release of ascospores of both L. maculans in England and L. biglobosa in Poland. Temperature did not affect release of ascospores over the range 5-20{\&}DEG; C. Diurnal periodicity in release of ascospores of L. maculans in England and L. biglobosa in Poland was similar. The timing (date) of first release of ascospores of L. maculans or L. biglobosa in autumn was related to rainfall in August and September; with increasing rainfall the date was earlier. The incubation periods from first release of ascospores to first appearance of phoma leaf spots for both L. maculans in England and L. biglobosa in Poland, and from first leaf spots to first stem base canker in England, were described using a thermal time (degree-day) approximation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many experiments in modern plant molecular biology require the processing of large numbers of samples for a variety of applications from mutant screens to the analysis of natural variants. A severe bottleneck to many such analyses is the acquisition of good yields of high quality RNA suitable for use in sensitive downstream applications such as real time quantitative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real time qRT-PCR). Although several commercial kits are available for high-throughput RNA extraction in 96-well format, only one non-kit method has been described in the literature using the commercial reagent TRIZOL. RESULTS: We describe an unusual phenomenon when using TRIZOL reagent with young Arabidopsis seedlings. This prompted us to develop a high-throughput RNA extraction protocol (HTP96) adapted from a well established phenol:chloroform-LiCl method (P:C-L) that is cheap, reliable and requires no specialist equipment. With this protocol 192 high quality RNA samples can be prepared in 96-well format in three hours (less than 1 minute per sample) with less than 1{\%} loss of samples. We demonstrate that the RNA derived from this protocol is of high quality and suitable for use in real time qRT-PCR assays. CONCLUSION: The development of the HTP96 protocol has vastly increased our sample throughput, allowing us to fully exploit the large sample capacity of modern real time qRT-PCR thermocyclers, now commonplace in many labs, and develop an effective high-throughput gene expression platform. We propose that the HTP96 protocol will significantly benefit any plant scientist with the task of obtaining hundreds of high quality RNA extractions.},

In this study, injured plants of wheat with blighting, stunting, and death of mature plants, also necrotic lesions on seminal crown roots, sub crown internodes and crown, as well as basal stem tissue symptoms were collected from different regions of Moghan wheat growing area. Fungi associated with wheat root and crown rot were isolated and identified based on general colony morphology, the morphology of mycelia, reproductive structure and taxonomic description. Also pathogenicity of 28 selected isolates from various identified species was determined on wheat (T. aestivum L. CV. Atila 4; a common grown cultivar of wheat in Moghan area) seedlings. The results indicated that the predominant pathogens implicated in causing common root and crown rot in this study was Bipolaris sorokiniana. In addition to B. sorokiniana, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium Pseudograminearum and Gaeumannomyces/Phiallophora complex are the most widely distributed species on wheat growing belt in Moghan area. Fusarium solani, Fusarium crookwellence, Fusarium clamidosporum, Fusarium proliferatum, Fusarium poa, Fusarium udum and Fusarium babinda are wheat root associated species of Fusarium ascertained during our investigation. Pathogenicity test revealed that B. sorokiniana, F. culmorum, F. graminearum, F. crookwellence, F. udum and Gaeumannomyces/Phiallophora complex are active pathogens and others are saprophytes, which are also involved in the destruction of root tissues, without being the cause of injury.},

abstract = {This article addresses the modelling of crop health and its impact on crop losses, with a special emphasis on plant diseases. Plant disease epidemiological models have many different shapes. We propose a summary of modelling structures for plant disease epidemics, which stem from the concepts of infection rate, of site, of basic infection rate corrected for removals (Rc), and of basic reproductive number (R0). Crop losses, the quantitative and qualitative impacts of diseases and pests on crop performances, can be expressed along many different dimensions. We focus on yield loss, defined as the difference between the attainable yield and the actual yield, in a production situation. The modelling of yield loss stems from the concept of damage mechanism, which can be applied to the wide range of organisms (including pathogens, weeds, arthropods, or nematodes) that may negatively affect crop growth and performances. Damage mechanisms are incorporated in crop growth models to simulate yield losses. In both fields, epidemiology and crop loss, we discuss the process of model development, including model simplification. We emphasize model simplification as a main avenue towards model genericity. This is especially relevant to enable addressing the diversity of crop pathogens and pests. We also discuss the usefulness of considering differing evaluation criteria depending on the stage of model development, and thus, depending on modelling objectives. We illustrate progress made on two global key crops where model simplification has been critical; rice and wheat. Modelling pests and diseases, and of the yield losses they cause on these two crops, lead us to propose the concept of crop health syndrome as a set of injury functions, each representing the dynamics of an injury (such as, for example, the time-course of an epidemic). Crop health in a given context can be represented by the set of such injury functions, which in turn can be used as drivers for crop loss models.},

abstract = {The objectives of the present study were to examine (i) the effect of whole season CO2 enrichment on seasonal radiation absorption and radiation use efficiency of above ground biomass production (RUE,) of wheat, (ii) the relationship between daily radiation use efficiency and temperature, and (iii) the effect of CO2 enrichment on this relationship in the period before and during grain filling when plant growth is assumed to be source and sink limited, respectively. During two consecutive years wheat (Tritictan aestivum L. cv. Minaret) was grown in open-top chambers at different plot sizes (1 and 3 m(2)) at ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations (ca. +280 ppm above ambient) with sufficient water and nutrient supply and analysed for final biomass and grain yield. In the 2nd year also light absorption by the green canopy and above ground biomass production were measured during the whole season. Canopy CO2 exchange rates (CCER) were recorded on 50 days (2nd year) from stem elongation until canopy senescence with canopy chambers. CCER were used for the calculation of daily radiation use efficiency of the net CO2 flux (dRUE2) before and during grain filling. Daily net carbon assimilation was linearly related to absorbed photosynthetic active radiation. Mean seasonal RUE2, which was calculated from this relationship, was increased by CO2 enrichment. This corresponded to the findings for RUE,. Seasonal light absorption was unaffected by the CO2 treatment. Final biomass and grain yield were increased under CO2 elevation by {\textless}11 and {\textless}13{\%} in the 1st and 2nd year, respectively. Regression analysis yielded a significant negative relationship between dRUE(2) and temperature under ambient CO2 in the period before and during grain filling. CO2 enrichment mitigated this negative relationship in the period only before but not during grain filling. The present experimental findings support the theoretically expected decrease of RUE at ambient CO2 and the increase of the CO2 effect with temperature in the preanthesis phase. The results also indicate that the Positive CO2 x temperature interaction on canopy assimilation disappears during grain filling, which might be responsible for the decrease of the CO2 effect on plant biomass between anthesis and grain maturity.

Here, we focus on recent findings and propose directions for future research that involve microbe-induced changes to plant defenses and nutritive quality as well as the consequences of these changes for the behavior and fitness of insect herbivores. Insect (herbivore and parasitoid)-associated microbes can favor or improve insect fitness by suppressing plant defenses and detoxifying de-fensive phytochemicals. Phytopathogens can influence or manipulate insect behavior and fitness by altering plant quality and defense. Plant-beneficial microbes can promote plant growth and influence plant nutritional and phy-tochemical composition that can positively or negatively influence insect fitness. Lastly, we suggest that entomopathogens have the potential to in-fluence plant defenses directly as endophytes or indirectly by altering insect physiology.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT A simple model has been developed to predict the onset of pseudothecia maturity and seasonal ascospore showers in relation to blackleg disease in canola, caused by the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans. The model considers a combination of two weather factors, daily mean temperature and daily total rainfall, to drive progress of maturity of pseudothecia on the infested canola stubble left from past crops. Each day is categorized as suitable or not suitable for progress of the maturation process. The onset of pseudothecia maturity occurs when approximately 43 suitable days have occurred. Following the onset of maturity, ascospore showers are triggered when daily rainfall exceeds a threshold. The model satisfactorily predicted the timing of the onset of pseudothecia maturity when tested with 3 years of field observations at four locations in Western Australia, which characteristically has a Mediterranean climate. The model also agreed reasonably well with the daily pattern of ascospore release observed in two locations. Sensitivity analysis was performed to show the relative importance of the parameters that describe the onset of pseudothecia maturity.},

abstract = {Alternaria is a ubiquitous fungal genus that includes saprobic, endophytic and pathogenic species associated with a wide variety of substrates. In recent years, DNA- based studies revealed multiple non-monophyletic genera within the Alternaria complex, and Alternaria species clades that do not always correlate to species-groups based on morphological characteristics. The Alternaria complex currently comprises nine genera and eight Alternaria sections. The aim of this study was to delineate phylogenetic lineages within Alternaria and allied genera based on nucleotide sequence data of parts of the 18S nrDNA, 28S nrDNA, ITS, GAPDH, RPB2 and TEF1-alpha gene regions. Our data reveal a Pleospora/Stemphylium clade sister to Embellisia annulata, and a well-supported Alternaria clade. The Alternaria clade contains 24 internal clades and six monotypic lineages, the assemblage of which we recognise as Alternaria. This puts the genera Allewia, Brachycladium, Chalastospora, Chmelia, Crivellia, Embellisia, Lewia, Nimbya, Sinomyces, Teretispora, Ulocladium, Undifilum and Ybotromyces in synonymy with Alternaria. In this study, we treat the 24 internal clades in the Alternaria complex as sections, which is a continuation of a recent proposal for the taxonomic treatment of lineages in Alternaria. Embellisia annulata is synonymised with Dendryphiella salina, and together with Dendryphiella arenariae, are placed in the new genus Paradendryphiella. The sexual genera Clathrospora and Comoclathris, which were previously associated with Alternaria, cluster within the Pleosporaceae, outside Alternaria s. str., whereas Alternariaster, a genus formerly seen as part of Alternaria, clusters within the Leptosphaeriaceae. Paradendryphiella is newly described, the generic circumscription of Alternaria is emended, and 32 new combinations and 10 new names are proposed. A further 10 names are resurrected, while descriptions are provided for 16 new Alternaria sections. Studies},

abstract = {A rapid nonstaining (KOH) method for the determination of the Gram reactions of bacteria is described, and its application to marine isolates is discussed. All gram-positive and gram-negative results obtained by Gram staining were con-firmed by the KOH method. Gram-variable bacteria produced equivocal results. A century ago, Hans Christian Gram devel-oped a staining procedure which enabled the separation of most commonly encountered bac-teria into two groups: gram positive and gram negative. Today, Gram staining remains the most important differential technique applied to bacteria (2); in fact, for 8 of the 19 major groupings of bacteria (1), staining is required as a primary aid to identification. Although many biochemical features of diagnostic bacteriology have been adapted for increased time-cost effi-ciency, the Gram stain technique is essentially the same now as it was in 1884. Premixed stains can be purchased, but the procedure is still relatively time consuming, costly, and often messy, and reagents must be replaced periodi-cally. Approximately 40 years ago, a simple and rapid nonstaining (KOH) method for the deter-mination of the Gram reaction appeared in the Japanese literature (3). The method was de-scribed once again and used for 69 strains of bacteria encountered in veterinary microbiology clinics (3). The efficacy of the KOH method was confirmed further with 22 bacteria of importance in the brewing industry (6). Quality control for the traditional Gram stain procedure was achieved with 100 clinical isolates (4), and, to keep costs down, the KOH method has been suggested for routine use in hospitals (5). In this study, I extended the usefulness of the KOH technique to the characterization of a large col-lection of marine bacteria. I hope to remind the teaching and research community of or intro-duce it to the effectiveness of the method. To perform the test, place a drop of 3{\%} aqueous KOH on a slide.

abstract = {Projected climate changes will affect wheat crop production both in the main processes of plant growth and development but also in the occurrences and severities of plant diseases. We assessed the potential infection periods of wheat leaf rust (WLR) at two climatologically different sites in Luxembourg. A threshold-based model, taking hourly values of air temperatures, relative humidity and precipitation during night-time into account, was used for calculating favourable WLR infection days during three periods throughout the cropping season. Field experiments were conducted during the 2003–2013 period at the selected sites. Projected climate data, from a multi model ensemble of regional climate models (spatial resolution 25 km) as well as an additional projection with a higher spatial resolution of 1.3 km, were used for investigating the potential WLR infection periods for two future time spans. Results showed that the infections of WLR were satisfactorily simulated during the development of wheat at both sites for the 2003–2013 period. The probabilities of WLR detection were close to 1 and the critical success index ranged from 0.80 to 0.94 (perfect score = 1 for both). Moreover, the highest proportions of favourable days of WLR infection were simulated during spring and summer at both sites. Regional climate projections showed an increase in temperatures by 1.6 K for 2041–2050 and by 3.7 K for 2091–2100 compared to the reference period 1991–2000. Positive trends in favourable WLR infection conditions occur at both sites more conducive than in the reference period due to projected climatic conditions.},

abstract = {Phosphine resistance positively contributes towards an individual's fitness under phosphine fumigation. However, phosphine resistance may place resistant individuals at a fitness disadvantage in the absence of this fumigant, which can be exploited to halt or slow down the spread of resistance. This study aimed to determine if there is a fitness cost associated with phosphine resistance in populations of the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum (Herbst)), the lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica (F.)) and the sawtoothed grain beetle (Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.)). The developmental rate and population growth of phosphine-resistant and -susceptible populations of these three species of stored-product insects were therefore determined under phosphine-free environment. The majority of the phosphine-resistant populations exhibited lower developmental and population growth rates than the susceptible populations indicating that phosphine resistance is associated with fitness cost in all three species, which can potentially compromise the fixation and dispersal of the resistant genotypes. Nonetheless, some phosphine-resistant populations did not show a fitness cost. Therefore, resistance management strategies based on suppression of phosphine use aiming at eventual reestablishment of phosphine susceptibility and subsequent reintroduction of this fumigant will be useful only for insect populations exhibiting a fitness cost associated with phosphine resistance. Therefore recognition of the prevailing phosphine-resistant genotypes in a region is important to direct the management tactics to be adopted.},

Fourteen-day-old seedlings of four hard white spring wheat genotypes which differ in their degree of resistance to the pathogen, based on the expression of visible symptoms, were inoculated using a droplet method and assessed weekly from 7 to 35 days after inoculation (dai) for both discoloration and fungal DNA content per unit of tissue weight. Both visual assessment of disease symptoms and qPCR of fungal biomass indicated significant differences between the partially resistant and susceptible wheat genotypes from 14 dai. Visual discoloration of leaf sheath tissues was strongly correlated with fungal biomass estimated by qPCR in all four genotypes; however, this correlation became weaker with increasing time after inoculation. Significant correlations between these parameters were indicated at 14, 21, and 28 dai whereas, by 35 dai, the correlation was not significant. Evaluation of plants at 14 dai provided a rapid test which gave clear discrimination between lines for both parameters and was the time point of closest correlation between fungal colonization and disease symptoms. Symptom expression at all times following inoculation was accompanied by tissue infection, and at no time was symptomless infection observed under this screening environment.

abstract = {Tribolium castaneum Herbst (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) is a common stored grain pest for which a wide range of suitable resources has been recorded. These beetles are facultatively fungivorous and their resource range may extend to fungi associated with non-grain resources (e.g. cotton seed) and other decaying plant matter. Little is known with respect to fungi in terms of resource location by these beetles in the field. We, therefore, conducted a series of experiments in laboratory arenas, glasshouse cages and the field to determine how beetles respond to grain resources in relation to cotton seed (together with its lint stubble and associated fungal flora). Results from the tests conducted in relatively small arenas and cages in the laboratory and glasshouse reveal that the responses of T. castaneum adults to food resources were twice as strong when walking as when flying (as measured by the proportion of the released beetles that were trapped). Also, a clear preference for linted cotton seeds was evident in walking T. castaneum, especially in small-scale arenas in the laboratory, where at least 60{\%} of beetles released preferred linted cotton seeds over wheat and sorghum. Similarly, in cages (1 m3) they responded five times more strongly to linted cotton seed than to conventional grain resources. However, this pattern was not consistent with those obtained from field trapping over 20 m and the beetles did not show any particular preference to any of the resources tested above. Our results suggest a focus on walking beetles in trapping studies for population estimations and, for developing effective food-based trapping lures, the potential use of active volatiles from the fungi associated with linted cotton seed.},

A simple and reliable method for assessing this disease would enhance our capacity in identifying resistance sources and developing resistant wheat cultivars. In searching for such a method, several inoculation techniques were tested. One technique, soaking 1- to 4-day old seedlings in fungal spore suspension, produced consistent and severe crown rot symptoms. Glasshouse testing of several wheat genotypes using this method produced results that agreed well with previously established field ratings for crown rot disease, suggesting that this assay can be conveniently employed for screening of wheat genotypes for crown rot resistance.},

abstract = {Genetic progress for yield has been assessed globally in the semi-arid wheat yield trials (SAWYTs) of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) over a 17-yr period. Grain yield expressed as a percentage of the long-term check cultivar Dharwar Dry has increased at approximately 1{\%} yr(-1) between 1994 and 2010. In real terms, yield has been increased at a rate of 31 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). The rate of yield increase in high-yielding environments was twice that of low-yielding environments. The average yield of low-yielding sites are significantly correlated with the average yield of high-yielding sites (p {\textless} 0.001), and many of the highest-yielding lines of the various SAWYT performed well at both low-and high-yielding sites. The key parents Attila and Pastor were consistently high yielding in several of the early SAWYT. In later trials their derivatives were also high yielding. The line Vorobey, developed by crossing Pastor with a synthetic derivative, showed outstanding yield in SAWYT 11 and 12. The performance of CIMMYT lines compared to local check cultivars was relatively stable over time. A success rate was calculated as the ratio of the number of sites where a given line is superior to the local check divided by the total number of sites. On average, the success rate of the 10{\%} best lines was 61{\%} in low-yielding sites and 62{\%} in high-yielding sites.},

abstract = {Foot rot and crown rot are fungal diseases of wheat caused by a complex of Fusarium species. They have a huge economic impact mainly due to yield reduction. A survey was conducted to identify four Fusarium species, occurring on wheat stem bases, using species-specific PCR assays in samples collected during spring of 2012. The dominant species was F. graminearum, which was identified in above 64 {\%} of samples. F. culmorum was detected in 15.71 {\%}, F. poae in 15.71 {\%} and F. sporotrichioides in 5.71 {\%} wheat fields. Most of the wheat fields in the eastern Poland were infected with at least one or two of Fusarium species, while in central Poland no Fusarium species were identified in most of the fields. The presence of F. graminearum tends to favor the presence of F. culmorum and this effect was visible also for F. poae and F. sporotrichioides. The frequency of F. graminearum and F. culmorum detections were highest where wheat crops were preceded by maize and in the samples from late sown fields. The opposite observation was made for F. poae and F. sporotrichioides, where the number of detections of these species was higher in samples from early sown fields. The number of detected Fusarium species was significantly lower in samples collected from fields protected with autumn herbicide in comparison to unprotected fields. The rate of autumn N fertilization did not affect the number of Fusarium detections. {\textcopyright} 2014, The Author(s).},

abstract = {Prioritizing research for crop health management is critical in times of rapid agricultural changes. A generic model for plant diseases, EPIRICE, was developed and coupled to a geographic information system (GIS) in order to map simulated potential epidemics in rice globally. EPIRICE encompasses different hierarchy levels of a growing crop canopy: disease-sites on a leaf, whole leaves, tillers, plants, crop stand, world regions, and world. Five widely different diseases were considered, caused by fungi, bacteria, and viruses, which have different disease-site and epidemiological attributes. EPIRICE is a simple Suscept-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model, parameterized using literature data for each of the five diseases, and combined with a few, simplified, characteristics of the growing crop (establishment, growth, senescence). Simulated outputs were tested against published disease progress curves, using visual and statistical, parametric and non-parametric, methods. Despite its simplicity, the model generates potential disease progress curves that concur with the literature. The model was linked to a GIS involving crop establishment date and daily climate data over a 12-year period of time. Successive epidemics were simulated at locations across the world, and their means and variances at each location were analyzed. Using rice as a model crop system, our results provide a proof of concept that it is possible to (1) use the same model (2) at different levels of plant and crop hierarchy, in order to (3) simulate and map potential plant disease epidemics globally. Further developments of this approach are discussed. The study also underscores the dearth of publicly available field data.},

abstract = {Powdery mildew of cucurbits, caused by Podosphaera xanthii (syn. Sphaerotheca fuliginia auct. p.p. (Schltdl.) Pollacci), is a common and often severe disease in most areas of the world. Field trials were conducted with cantaloupe to compare disease management success provided by conventional fungicides and biofungicides having different inherent efficacies and modes of action, when applied alone throughout the treatment period or as components of fungicide application programs. Additionally, the portion of total disease control provided by each component fungicide within selected rotational programs was determined. When applied alone throughout the treatment period, disease severity in 2008 and 2009 compared with nontreated plants was reduced by values of 100, 99.3, and 98.1{\%} by wettable sulfur (Microthiol Disperss), triflumizole (Procure), and quinoxyfen (Quintec), respectively; 83.9, 76.4, and 57.4{\%} by trifloxystrobin (Flint), pyraclostrobin (Cabrio), or azoxystrobin (Quadris), respectively; and 39.8, 31.1, 30.0, and 28.6{\%} by thiophanate-methyl (Topsin M), potassium bicarbonate (Kaligreen), kresoxim-methyl (Sovran), and Bacillus subtilis (Serenade), respectively. Rotational application programs composed of Microthiol Disperss, Procure, and Quintec reduced powdery mildew severity on cantaloupe by 97.5 to 100{\%} in both trials. In comparison, disease reduction of 86.0 to 100{\%} was achieved when the first and third fungicide applications were Quintec or Procure and the second and fourth applications were Cabrio, Flint, Kaligreen, Quadris, Serenade, Sovran, or Topsin M. In field trials designed to elucidate the portion of total disease control provided by each component fungicide within a rotational program, application sequences of Procure, Streptomyces lydicus (Actinovate), Procure, and Actinovate or Procure, Kaligreen, Procure, and Kaligreen resulted in reductions in powdery mildew severity of 69.1 and 78.7{\%}, respectively. In comparison, inclusion of only the two Procure applications brought about a mean disease reduction of 85{\%}, whereas inclusion of only the two Actinovate or Kaligreen applications reduced the level of powdery mildew control to 17.6 and 12.9{\%}, respectively. The usefulness of fungicides with low inherent efficacy as resistance management partners when applied with highly efficacious at-risk fungicides may be questioned; however, the importance of any fungicide as a resistance management partner should be measured by its ability to dilute the selection pressure of the at-risk fungicide and to inhibit the growth of any resistant biotypes that may arise, factors which may not be reflected by its inherent efficacy in controlling disease. Because less efficacious fungicides did not increase the overall level of disease control, encouraging growers and pest control advisors to incorporate them into powdery mildew treatment programs may be a challenge, because resistance management is not their top priority. An ongoing educational effort emphasizing the benefits of resistance management programs with respect to prolonging the effectiveness of single-site mode of action fungicides is essential. {\textcopyright} 2013 The American Phytopathological Society.},

abstract = {This study examines the effects of climate warming on one of the most widely distributed and destructive forest pathogens, Phytophthora cinnamomi. In Europe, the winter survival of the pathogen is the dominant cue for the development of the disease it causes to oaks, especially Quercus robur and Q. rubra. The potential pathogen and disease geographic ranges were compared in France between two reference periods, 1968–1998 and 2070–2099. Simulations were obtained by combining a physiologically based approach predicting the pathogen winter survival in relation to microhabitat temperature (in the phloem of infected trees) with a regionalized climatic scenario derived from a global circulation model. Positive anomalies in winter temperatures calculated with this scenario were in the range 0.5–5.1C between the periods 2070–2099 and the 1968–1998, according to sites and months. As a consequence, higher annual rates of P. cinnamomi survival were predicted, resulting in a potential range expansion of the disease of one to a few hundred kilometers eastward from the Atlantic coast within one century. Based on this example, the study emphasizes the need of a better understanding of the impacts of global change on the biotic constraint constituted by plant pathogens.},

See attached image Fig. 5 Mapping of F0.05 and F0.5 in Quercus rubra (frequencies of years with Phytophthora cinnamomi annual survival rate below the 0.05 and 0.5 thresholds) for periods 1968–1998 and 2070–2099.

Paper uses a notation of F0.5 as no disease expression and F0.05 as no P.cinnamomi survival
therefore (10{\%}oF0.05(1968–1998)o40{\%}) means chance of no survival(F0.05) is between 10{\%} to 40{\%} in 1968 to 98
Pathogen-induced diseases are strong forces that affect ecosystem structure and functioning via population vitality and community diversity, as demonstrated in undisturbed environments (Augspurger, 1984; Van der Putten et al., 1993; Dobson {\&} Crawley, 1994; Hansen {\&} Goheen, 2000; Gilbert, 2002) and also exemplified in past and current epidemics (Grente, 1961; Anagnostakis, 1987; Weste {\&} Marks, 1987; Harvell et al., 2002).I have written a piec e alot like this in my Lit Rev

It was based on the fact that the geographic distribution of ink disease in oaks is still restricted to a small part of its host range more than a century after the supposed introduction of the pathogen in France (1860) and 40 years after its first mention in oaks (Moreau {\&} Moreau, 1952). p2 (ie first mentioned in oaks around 1928s in france)

A model of P. cinnamomi survival in oak trunks as a function of air temperature and tree characteristics was then developed. The actual disease development (from dendrochronological data) was significantly positively related to the predicted pathogen survival (Marc¸ais et al., 1996).p2

A climatic disease risk mapping based on P. cinnamomi survival was then developed by using the survival model integrated with meteorological data from a past 30-year period (Bergot et al., 2001; Desprez-Loustau et al., 2002). p2/3

November showed the highest and spatially most homogeneous anomalies for both minimum and maximum temperatures. In most other months and for both types of temperatures, the anomalies increased in a northwest to southeast gradient. The highest nomalies were obtained in the high elevation areas of the Alps, in December and January and to a lesser extent February, for minimum temperatures. Sharp gradients in mountainous areas were also observed for anomalies in maximum temperatures, p6

Locations with a moderate disease risk (10{\%}oF0.05(1968–1998)o40{\%}) may become even more favorable to disease, but, more remarkably, many locations previously excluded from disease risk (40{\%}oF0.5(1968–1998)o75{\%}) are expected to become at risk (F0.5(2070–2099)o40{\%}), for both oak species.

The potential expansion of moderate risk zones (10{\%}oF0.5o40{\%},) is higher, especially in the northcentral part of the country. Finally, zones previously considered as nonsuitable for disease development (F0.5440{\%}) may display a dramatic decrease from
approximately two-thirds to one-third (Q. rubra) and one-half to one-quarter (Q. robur) of total country surface area. p6Drier soil implies lesser cooling by evaporation during the day and thus higher maximum temperatures. The difference between GCMs can also be explained by cloud feedback. Clouding is a crucial factor, having both warming (especially on minimum temperatures) and cooling effects (especially on maximum temperatures), but still constitutes a major uncertainty in GCMs (Loehle, 1996). p9

Indeed, an advanced timing in the nesting of birds or in the phenology of plants and animals has already been bserved, most probably reflecting the recent increase in temperatures (Roy {\&} Sparks, 2000; Pen˜ uelas et al., 2002; Walther et al., 2002).Global warming is also projected to favor range shifts, especially poleward migrations, for many species for which temperatures are the main limiting factor of geographic distribution (Parmesan et al., 1999; Saxe et al., 2001; Bale et al., 2002; Harvell et al., 2002). p9

This shift in the climate envelope, even with a moderate greenhouse effect scenario such as B2, is far beyond the migration rates
inferred from fossil records in response to past quaternary climate changes, indicating much faster climatic change in the recent times (Davis {\&} Shaw, 2001). p9

Disease zoning will have to consider not only climatic constraints but also all factors conditioning pathogen spread in their climatic envelopes, especially resource availability (susceptible hosts) and dispersal (Walther et al., 2002). p12

Indirect effects of climate on host physiology, especially water stress, that were shown to influence disease development (Marc¸ais et al., 1993; Bunny et al., 1995) should also be included. The improvement of risk projections first relies on the improvement of the epidemiological model p12},

abstract = {This review analyses potential effects of global warming, i.e. higher mean temperatures, on the life cycle of five economically important oilseed rape pathogens in Northern Germany using a meta-analytical approach. First, the currently available but strongly fragmented knowledge about temperature influences on individual life cycle stages of the referred pathogens, such as survival, sporulation, infection and disease progress is summarised. These data are compared with current regional climate projections (REMO model) based on emission scenario A1B for the periods 2001-2030 and 2071-2100 in three different oilseed rape growing regions in Lower Saxony, Germany, using a baseline historical series of meteorological data collected from 1971 to 2000. Our analysis suggests that warming might lead to shifts in the future prevalence of these pathogens. Verticillium longisporum, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Alternaria brassicae could be particularly favoured, but beneficial effects may also occur for certain life cycle stages of Phoma lingam, such as infection and stem canker development. Pyrenopeziza brassicae might even lose importance under future warming. These changes may be particularly explicit in the long-term view (2071-2100). However, predictions on potential disease shifts are restricted by a lack of reliable, high-resolution future climate scenarios and complicated by the prospective adaptations of farming techniques and crop genotypes to climate change.

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Most of the disease resistance genes already characterized in plants encode nucleotide-binding site–leucine rich repeat (NBS–LRR) proteins that have key roles in resistance to Verticillium dahliae. Using a cDNA library and RACE protocols, we cloned a coiled-coil (CC)–NBS–LRR-type gene, GbRVd, from a resistant tetraploid cotton species, Gossypium barbadense (RVd = Resistance to V. dahliae). We also applied RT-qPCR and VIGS technologies to ana-lyze how expression of GbRVd was induced upon attack by V. dahliae. Its 2862-bp ORF encodes a predicted protein containing 953 amino acid residues, with a predicted molecular weight of 110.17 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.87. GbRVd has three domains – CC, NBS, and LRR – and is most closely related to Gossypium raimondii RVd (88{\%} amino acid identity). Profiling demonstrated that GbRVd is constitutively expressed in all tested tissues, and tran-script levels are especially high in the leaves. In plants inoculated with V. dahliae, GbRVd was significantly up-regulated when compared with the control, with expression peaking at 48 h post-inoculation. Silencing of GbRVd in cotton through VIGS dramatically down-regulated SA, NO, and H 2 O 2 production, resulting in greater susceptibility to V. dahliae. Taken together, these results suggest that GbRVd has an important role in protecting G. barbadense against infection by V. dahliae.},

abstract = {A simple model, G1 Blackspot Manager, has been developed to predict the seasonal pattern of release of ascospores in relation to ascochyta blight in field pea. The model considers a combination of two weather factors, daily mean temperature and daily total rainfall, to drive progress of maturity of pseudothecia on infested field pea stubble from past crops. Each day is categorised as suitable or not suitable for continuation of the maturation process. The onset of pseudothecial maturity has been found to take place when approximately ten suitable days have occurred. Following the onset of maturity, ascospore release is triggered when daily rainfall exceeds a threshold. The model was satisfactorily calibrated using three datasets from Western Australia. The calibrated model performed well when independently tested with 21 datasets, 17 from Western Australia and 4 from South Australia. It is concluded that G1 Blackspot Manager model has the potential to be used to formulate sowing guides for field pea in southern Australia that minimise the risk of ascochyta blight.},

abstract = {This paper offers projections of potential effects of climate change on rusts of wheat and how we should factor in a changing climate when planning for the future management of these diseases. Even though the rusts of wheat have been extensively studied internationally, there is a paucity of information on the likely effects of a changing climate on the rusts and their influence on wheat production. Due to the lack of published empirical research we relied on the few published studies of other plant diseases, our own unpublished work and relevant information from the vast literature on rusts of wheat to prepare this overview. Three broad areas of potential risks from a changing climate were described: increased loss from wheat rusts, new rust pathotypes evolving faster and the reduced effectiveness of rust resistances. Increased biomass of wheat crops grown in the presence of elevated CO2 concentrations and higher temperatures will increase the leaf area available for attack by the pathogen leading to increased inoculum production. If changed weather conditions were to accelerate the life cycle of a pathogen, the increased inoculum can lead to severe rust epidemics in many environments. Likewise should the effects of climate change result in more conducive conditions for rust development there will also be a corresponding increase in the rate of evolution of new pathotypes which could increase the rate of appearance of new virulences. The effectiveness of some rust resistance genes is influenced by temperature and crop development stage. Climate change may directly or indirectly influence the effectiveness of some resistance genes but this can not be ascertained due to a complete lack of knowledge. Since disease resistance breeding is a long term strategy it is important to determine if any of the important genes may become less effective due to climate change. Studies must be made to acquire new information on the rust disease triangle to increase the adaptive capacity of wheat under climate change. Leadership within the Borlaug Global Rust Initiative (BGRI) is needed to broker research on rust evolution and the durability of resistance under climate change.},

abstract = {The acquisition by parasites of the capacity to infect resistant host genotypes, that is, resistance-breaking, is predicted to be hindered by across-host fitness trade-offs. All analyses of costs of resistance-breaking in plant viruses have focused on within-host multiplication without considering other fitness components, which may limit understanding of virus evolution. We have reported that host range expansion of tobamoviruses on L-gene resistant pepper genotypes was associated with severe within-host multiplication penalties. Here, we analyze whether resistance-breaking costs might affect virus survival in the environment by comparing tobamovirus pathotypes differing in infectivity on L-gene resistance alleles. We predicted particle stability from structural models, analyzed particle stability in vitro, and quantified virus accumulation in different plant organs and virus survival in the soil. Survival in the soil differed among tobamovirus pathotypes and depended on differential stability of virus particles. Structure model analyses showed that amino acid changes in the virus coat protein (CP) responsible for resistance-breaking affected the strength of the axial interactions among CP subunits in the rod-shaped particle, thus determining its stability and survival. Pathotypes ranked differently for particle stability/survival and for within-host accumulation. Resistance-breaking costs in survival add to, or subtract from, costs in multiplication according to pathotype. Hence, differential pathotype survival should be considered along with differential multiplication to understand the evolution of the virus populations. Results also show that plant resistance, in addition to selecting for resistance-breaking and for decreased multiplication, also selects for changes in survival, a trait unrelated to the host-pathogen interaction that may condition host range expansion.},

abstract = {The assessment of plant resistance to viral infection under elevated carbon dioxide [ECO2] conditions is a key step in the development of plant-pathogen management. We quantified the aboveground biomass, foliar TNCs (total non-structural carbohydrates): Nitrogen ratio, and nicotine content of a tobacco cultivar (NC89) in two CO2 treatments after Potato virus Y-N (PVYN) infection. Foliar peroxidase (POD) activity, total amino acid content, soluble protein content, and chlorophyll content were also tested to explore the potential interaction of ECO2 and PVYN infection on tobacco secondary indices. ECO2 increased plant aboveground biomass, did not significantly influence TNCs or nitrogen content; while PVYN infection had adverse effects on biomass, markedly affected the later two indices; but no interactive effects between ECO2 and PVYN infection on these three indices were detected. As single factor, ECO2 or PVYN infection reduced chlorophyll content, while ECO2 increased the soluble protein content; interaction between two factors was observed on free amino acid and nicotine content. Variations in POD activity revealed that CO2 influenced infected plant primary production by reducing virus resistance cost. Results suggested that plants grown under ECO2 have alleviated damage of the virus infection or ECO2 delay the viral spread to some extent. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {When the fungal pathogen Gibberella moniliformis (anamorph, Fusarium verticillioides) colonizes maize and maize-based products, it produces class B fumonisin (FB) mycotoxins, which are a significant threat to human and animal health. FB biosynthetic enzymes and accessory proteins are encoded by a set of clustered and cotranscribed genes collectively named FUM, whose molecular regulation is beginning to be unraveled by researchers. FB accumulation correlates with the amount of transcripts from the key FUM genes, FUM1, FUM21, and FUM8. In fungi in general, gene expression is often partially controlled at the chromatin level in secondary metabolism; when this is the case, the deacetylation and acetylation (and other posttranslational modifications) of histones are usually crucial in the regulation of transcription. To assess whether epigenetic factors regulate the FB pathway, we monitored FB production and FUM1, FUM21, and FUM8 expression in the presence of a histone deacetylase inhibitor and verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation the relative degree of histone acetylation in the promoter regions of FUM1, FUM21, and FUM8 under FB-inducing and noninducing conditions. Moreover, we generated transgenic F. verticillioides strains expressing GFP under the control of the FUM1 promoter to determine whether its strength under FB-inducing and noninducing conditions was influenced by its location in the genome. Our results indicate a clear and differential role for chromatin remodeling in the regulation of FUM genes. This epigenetic regulation can be attained through the modulation of histone acetylation at the level of the promoter regions of the key biosynthetic genes FUM1 and FUM21, but less so for FUM8.},

Whatever the time following inoculation there were no statistical differences between numbers of phytoplasma cells in plants infected by Map-FD1 (FD-CAM05) and Map-FD2 (FD92 and FD-PEY05) genotype strains. On the contrary, temperature had an influence on Flavescence dor,e phytoplasma multiplication which was nearly twice as fast in broad beans incubated at 25 A degrees C than in broad beans incubated at 20 A degrees C.

abstract = {An irrigated cropping systems experiment was conducted for 6 years in east-central Washington State to examine agronomic and economic alternatives to continuous annual winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) with burning and plowing, and to determine how root diseases of cereals are influenced by management practices. The continuous winter wheat treatment with burning and plowing was compared with a 3-year no-till rotation of winter wheat-spring barley (Hordeum vulgare)-winter canola (Brassica napus) and three straw management treatments: burning, straw removal, and leaving the straw stubble standing after harvest. Take-all disease and inoculum increased from years I to 4 in the continuous winter wheat treatment with burning and plowing, reducing plant growth compared to the no-till treatments with crop rotations. Inoculum of Rhizoctonia solani AG-8 was significantly lower in the tilled treatment compared to the no-till treatments. Inoculum concentration of Fusarium pseudograminearum was higher than that of F culmorum, and in one of three years, the former was higher in treatments with standing stubble and mechanical straw removal compared to burned treatments. Residue management method had no effect on Rhizoctonia inoculum, but spring barley had more crown roots and tillers and greater height with stubble burning. This 6-year study showed that irrigated winter wheat can be produced in a no-till rotation without major disease losses and demonstrated how cropping practices influence the dynamics of soilborne cereal diseases and inoculum over time.},

Statistically significant year × treatment interactions for almost all of the variables measured suggest that variable environmental conditions each year play a strong role in disease expression. Another explanation is that disease and inoculum dynamics change over the course of a cropping system or rotation (29). For example, takeall increased over time in the continuous winter wheat treatment, and burning and plowing did not reduce this disease over the first 4 years of the rotation

abstract = {This review describes those mechanisms by which wind directly affects crop growth rates and hence yields. Wind-induced plant movement is capable of altering growth rates and leaf morphology, although this is unlikely to be a major cause of growth differences between sheltered and unsheltered crops grown outdoors. The wind's force can tear leaves or strip them from the plant. Dense plant canopies may suffer abrasion through intermittent or constant rubbing. Soil particles lifted into suspension by the wind have the potential to abrade and damage plant tissue. The wind's force can physically knock plants over, making crops difficult to harvest. Each of these mechanisms operates at a particular time of the growing season. Recovery, and hence final yield, depends on the growth stage and soil/plant moisture status when;he damage occurred, the particular species and variety as well as the preceding and subsequent weather. The fact that damage effects are so dependent on the crop and the past weather makes modelling and any simple synthesis of direct wind effects difficult. The most common forms of damage likely in Australia's agricultural regions are from sandblasting and lodging. These damage events will be intermittent - their frequency depending on the local climate. Leaf tearing is likely in broad-leafed horticultural crops, and growth effects are also likely in any windy location. It is not possible to predict what the impact of this damage, and other direct effects, will be on final yields, Based on the results in the literature, protection from damage offered by windbreaks may have as large an effect on yields as incremental microclimate benefits.},

Today the direct role of pathogens in natural plant communities is better recognized than at previous times, although the nuances of their interactions and the cascade of ramifications that can flow through changing biotic and abiotic effects are only now gaining recognition. However, as human influence on pathogens increases either directly through enhanced if accidental dispersal, or through anthropogenic impacts on climate-we may expect to see increasing evidence of pathogens affecting plant species, community structure, and ecosystem function.},

abstract = {The prevalence of resistance to phosphine in the rust-red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, from eastern Australia was investigated, as well as the potential fitness cost of this type of resistance. Discriminating dose tests on 115 population samples collected from farms from 2006 to 2010 showed that populations containing insects with the weakly resistant phenotype are common in eastern Australia (65.2{\%} of samples), although the frequency of resistant phenotypes within samples was typically low (median of 2.3{\%}). The population cage approach was used to investigate the possibility that carrying the alleles for weak resistance incurs a fitness cost. Hybridized populations were initiated using a resistant strain and either of two different susceptible strains. There was no evidence of a fitness cost based on the frequency of susceptible phenotypes in hybridized populations that were reared for seven generations without exposure to phosphine. This suggests that resistant alleles will tend to persist in field populations that have undergone selection even if selection pressure is removed. The prevalence of resistance is a warning that this species has been subject to considerable selection pressure and that effective resistance management practices are needed to address this problem. The resistance prevalence data also provide a basis against which to measure management success.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2013 British Society for Plant Pathology.This study examines the CO2-mediated influence of plant resistance on crown rot dynamics under continuous cropping of partially resistant wheat line 249 and the susceptible cultivar Tamaroi. Disease incidence, severity, deoxynivalenol and Fusarium biomass were assessed after each cycle in microcosms established at ambient and 700 mg kg-1 CO2 using soil and stubble of these wheat lines from a field experiment with free to air CO2 enrichment. Monoconidial isolates from wheat stubble were collected initially, and after five cropping cycles, to compare the frequency and aggressiveness of Fusarium species in the two populations. Aggressiveness was measured using a high-throughput seedling bioassay. At elevated CO2, the higher initial incidence in Tamaroi increased with cropping cycles, but incidence in 249 remained unchanged. Incidence at ambient CO2 did not change for either line. Elevated CO2 induced partial resistance in Tamaroi, but not in 249. Increased Fusarium biomass in wheat tissue at elevated CO2 matched raised deoxynivalenol of the stem base in both lines. After five cycles of continuous wheat cropping, aggressiveness increased in pathogenic F. culmorum and F. pseudograminearum by 110{\%}, but decreased in weakly pathogenic F. equiseti and F. oxysporum by 50{\%}. CO2 and host resistance interactively influenced species frequency, and the highly aggressive F. pseudograminearum became dominant on Tamaroi irrespective of CO2 concentration, while its frequency declined on 249. This study shows that induced resistance at elevated CO2 will not reduce crown rot severity, or impede the selection and enrichment of Fusarium populations with increased aggressiveness.},

abstract = {APSIM-wheat is a crop system simulation model, consisting of modules that incorporate aspects of soil water, nitrogen (N), residues, and crop development. The model was used to simulate above- and belowground growth, grain yield, water and N uptake, and soil water and soil N in wheat crops in Western Australia. Model outputs were compared with detailed field experiments from four rainfall zones, three soil types, and five wheat genotypes. The field experiments covered 10 seasons, with variations in sowing date, plant density, N fertiliser, deep ripping and irrigation. The overall APSIM model predictions of shoot growth, root depth, water and N uptake, soil water, soil N, drainage and nitrate leaching were found to be acceptable. Grain yields were well predicted with a coefficient of determination r2(1:1)=0.77, despite some underestimation during severe terminal droughts. Yields tended to be underestimated during terminal droughts due to insufficient pre-anthesis stored carbohydrates being remobilised to the grain. Simulation of grain protein, and depth to the perched water table showed limited accuracy when compared with field measurements. In particular, grain protein tended to be overpredicted at high protein levels and underpredicted at low levels. However, specific simulation studies to predict biomass, yield, drainage and nitrate leaching are now possible for wheat crops on the tested soil types and rainfall zones in Western Australia.},

@article{Juroszek2013c,
abstract = {This review summarizes the most significant results from the so far existing, but fragmented studies on the potential effects of climate change on wheat pathogens and the diseases they cause. The analysis demonstrates that predictions are uncertain and future disease risk trends must be differentiated on a geographic and time scale. For example, disease incidence of Fusarium head blight in the United Kingdom might increase middle of this century, whereas disease severity of Septoria tritici blotch might decrease in France end of this century. Thus, wheat disease problems caused by a changing climate will probably not consistently worsen, as climatic changes may also improve the crop health situation in wheat depending on the location. The results of long-term simulations of future disease risk must be taken with caution, because different climate models and downscaling methods are used to make the projections and this can create considerable uncertainty. Being aware of this short-coming, plant pathologists recently started to assess the sources of uncertainty related to their long-term disease simulations. However, in spite of this progress there is still a significant lack of simulation studies related to different wheat diseases in various locations that could help to estimate future wheat grain losses due to climatic changes. Many more of these studies are certainly needed. Otherwise, the focus in the climate change debate will remain on the yield loss/gain potential due to changes in the environmental conditions only, which would neglect the important impact of altered biotic constraints such as diseases which are among the key factors in the estimation of future global wheat productivity.},

Assessment of the impacts of climate change on pest infestations and disease epidemics in crops is needed as a basis for revising management practices to minimize crop losses as climatic conditions shift. Future scenarios focused on the decades of the 2020' s, 2050' s, and 2080' s ( scenarios A2 and B2) were obtained from five General Circulation Models available on Data Distribution Centre from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Geographic distribution maps were prepared using models to predict the number of generations of the nematodes and leaf miner. Maps obtained in scenario A2 allowed prediction of an increased infestation of the nematode and of the pest, due to greater number of generations per month, than occurred under the climatological normal from 1961 - 1990. The number of generations also increased in the B2 scenario, but was lower than in the A2 scenario for both organisms.},

We conducted studies to elucidate the potential frequency and nature of sexual reproduction in field populations of F. pseudograminearum and developed tester strains for controlled crossings under laboratory conditions. Studies on the role of sexual recombination in the life cycle of F. pseudograminearum revealed apparently low levels of female fertility under controlled laboratory conditions, despite the observation of naturally occurring perithecia of the teleomorph Gibberella coronicola at two field sites. Female fertility levels were experimentally increased to produce female fertile tester strains using four generations of single and multi-stage crossings between sibling progeny derived from fertile laboratory crosses between field isolates collected in northeastern Australia. The production of reliable female fertile tester strains has potential applications for the construction of biological species boundaries, elucidation of the physical characters of reproductive structures, and the generation of genetic diversity via sexual recombination in F. pseudograminearum. As such, the current study is a significant advancement in the understanding of G. coronicola, allowing for future characterisation of various biological, epidemiological, and genetic parameters. {\textcopyright} 2008 The British Mycological Society.},

abstract = {Extreme climate, especially temperature, can severely reduce wheat yield. As global warming has already begun to increase mean temperature and the occurrence of extreme temperatures, it has become urgent to accelerate the 520 similar to year process of breeding for new wheat varieties, to adapt to future climate. We analyzed the patterns of frost and heat events across the Australian wheatbelt based on 50 similar to years of historical records (19602009) for 2864 weather stations. Flowering dates of three contrasting-maturity wheat varieties were simulated for a wide range of sowing dates in 22 locations for current climate (19602009) and eight future scenarios (high and low CO2 emission, dry and wet precipitation scenarios, in 2030 and 2050). The results highlighted the substantial spatial variability of frost and heat events across the Australian wheatbelt in current and future climates. As both last frost and first heat events would occur earlier in the season, the target sowing and flowering windows (defined as risk less than 10{\%} for frost ({\textless}0 similar to degrees C) and less than 30{\%} for heat ({\textgreater}35 similar to degrees C) around flowering) would be shifted earlier by up to 2 and 1 similar to month(s), respectively, in 2050. A short-season variety would require a shift in target sowing window 2-fold greater than long- and medium-season varieties by 2050 (8 vs. 4 days on average across locations and scenarios, respectively), but would suffer a lesser decrease in the length of the vegetative period (4 vs. 7 days). Overall, warmer winters would shorten the wheat season by up to 6 weeks, especially during preflowering. This faster crop cycle is associated with a reduced time for resource acquisition, and potential yield loss. As far as favourable rain and modern equipment would allow, early sowing and longer season varieties (i.e. in current climate) would be the best strategies to adapt to future climates.},

abstract = {Climate models vary widely in their projections of both global mean temperature rise and regional climate changes, but are there any systematic differences in regional changes associated with different levels of global climate sensitivity? This paper examines model projections of climate change over the twenty-first century from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report which used the A2 scenario from the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios, assessing whether different regional responses can be seen in models categorized as ‘high-end' (those projecting 4°C or more by the end of the twenty-first century relative to the preindustrial). It also identifies regions where the largest climate changes are projected under high-end warming. The mean spatial patterns of change, normalized against the global rate of warming, are generally similar in high-end and ‘non-high-end' simulations. The exception is the higher latitudes, where land areas warm relatively faster in boreal summer in high-end models, but sea ice areas show varying differences in boreal winter. Many continental interiors warm approximately twice as fast as the global average, with this being particularly accentuated in boreal summer, and the winter-time Arctic Ocean temperatures rise more than three times faster than the global average. Large temperature increases and precipitation decreases are projected in some of the regions that currently experience water resource pressures, including Mediterranean fringe regions, indicating enhanced pressure on water resources in these areas.},

abstract = {The AGFACE project commenced in June 2007 at Horsham (36 degrees 45'07 '' S, 142 degrees 06'52 '' E; 127 m elevation), Victoria, Australia. Its aim is to quantify the interactive effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (e[CO(2)]), nitrogen, temperature (accomplished by early and late sowing times), and soil moisture on the growth, yield, and water use of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under Australian conditions. The main engineering goal of the project was to maintain an even temporal and spatial distribution of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) at 550 mu mol/mol within AGFACE rings containing the experimental treatments. Monitoring showed that e[CO(2)] at the ring-centres was maintained at or above 90{\%} of the target (495 mmol/mol) between 93 and 98{\%} of the operating time across the 8 rings and within +/- 10{\%} of the target (495-605 mu mol/mol) between 86 and 94{\%} of the time. The carbon dioxide concentration ([ CO2]) measured inside the rings declined non-linearly with increasing distance downwind of the CO(2) source and differed by 3-13{\%} in concentration between the two canopy heights in each ring, but was not affected by wind speed or small variations in [CO(2)] at the ring-centres. The median values for model-predicted concentrations within the inner 11-m-diameter portion of the rings ({\textgreater}80{\%} of the ring area) varied between 524 and 871 mmol/mol but remained close to target near the centres. The design criteria adopted from existing pure CO(2) fumigating FACE systems and new ideas incorporated in the AGFACE system provided a performance similar to its equivalent systems. This provides confidence in the results that will be generated from experiments using the AGFACE system.},

@article{Barbetti2012a,
abstract = {Climate change not only influences agricultural and horticultural crops but also the diseases that affect them. The different parameters associated with climate change, such as warmer temperatures, increased levels of CO2, decreased rainfall and increased rainfall variability, have been widely studied in terms of their influence on different aspects of pathogens and diseases across various crops. This includes pathogen life cycle, expression of host resistance, disease epidemiology and severity of disease epidemics, as well as pathogen inoculum production. Less well studied are the potential changes in pathogen biodiversity, such as development of races or pathotypes, in response to climate change. Future changes in both pathogen diversity and pathogen threats are built on the complex changes in crops and agricultural practices that can occur with or without climate change. Pathogens are successful opportunists that occupy any niche that is not adequately protected by crop protection strategies, including host resistance. Climate change will influence future changes in the distribution and the challenge of future pathogen threats and corresponding changes in pathogen diversity. Fungal and oomycete pathogens occurring on oilseed Brassicas provide strong indications of the abilities of pathogens to readily adapt to changes in climate, including changes in crops or cropping systems in response to future climate scenarios. Some existing climates, such as Mediterranean climates and regions, are historically highly variable in terms of environmental parameters, including the amount, timing and variability of temperature anti rainfall. These environments offer significant prospects for gaining a better insight and understanding of the processes involved with pathogen adaptation to future climate scenarios. While there have been attempts to date to define future expansion or contractions of some particular diseases in relation to future climate scenarios, including some diseases occurring on oilseed Brassicas, defining future distribution ranges of the most important pathogens, their races, and consequent disease challenges in relation to future climate changes remains an area of high priority. This information is critical for monitoring such changes over time and also for designing pre-emptive management strategies against pathogen threats for crops under future climate scenarios. Surprisingly, relatively little has been defined in terms of traits such as increased frequency of drought, higher temperatures, unpredictable and erratic wetting and drying cycles, salinity and inundation events in terms of the genes that determine differences in tolerance to such traits. Oilseed Brassicas include a range of different species making them an ideal prospect for use as a 'model' plant grouping for investigating and modelling impacts of biotic and abiotic stresses and their interactions under future climate scenarios. As a first step, the anticipated shifts in biotic and abiotic stress thresholds that occur across current environments for established and new Brassica crop species as a result of climate change could be defined. This includes how predicted future abiotic stresses could not only pre-dispose some species to more severe disease infections but also how they alter both pathogen diversity and expression of host resistances to diseases. Subsequently, the potential impacts of changing Brassica crop species on other components of cropping systems across different countries representing different current and future climate scenarios cold be defined. Using oilseed Brassicas as model species will not only define the potential hazards involved in simply shifting crop species initially to overcome abiotic limitations imposed by climate change, but will actually define the basis for capturing the benefits and opportunities these alternative Brassica species offer as a means of coping with climate change. In this way, oilseed Brassicas could be utilized to define pre-emptive management strategies, such as by breeding for better and/more appropriate types and levels of host resistance to pathogens and deploying host resistances in better and more controlled ways to maximize the longevity of such host resistance in the face of changing pathogen pathotypes. This review will utilize the outcomes of studies in relation to pathogens, particularly pathogen biodiversity, and diseases of oilseed Brassicas over past decades as a basis for outlining the challenges, opportunities and priorities for improving on current management successes such that crop yields can be maintained in the face of expected pathogen threats likely to occur under future climate scenarios.

abstract = {Target trait evaluation in crop wild relatives is an important prerequisite for efficiently using the potential useful genes located in this valuable germplasm. Over recent decades, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense tropical race 4 (Foc-TR4) has seriously threatened worldwide banana plantations. Breeding new resistant cultivars from wild banana species is expected to provide invaluable additional resources. However, knowledge on resistance to Foc-TR4 in wild Musa species is very limited. In this study, eight genotypes of wild banana relatives (Musa acuminata subsp. burmannica, M. balbisiana, M. basjoo, M. itinerans, M. nagensium, M. ruiliensis, M. velutina and M. yunnanensis) were characterized for resistance to Foc-TR4 in both greenhouse and field conditions. Most wild bananas showed higher resistance levels to Foc-TR4 than the reference cultivars ‘Brazilian' (AAA, susceptible) and ‘Goldfinger' (AAAB, moderate resistance). Among the wild species, M. balbisiana showed the highest levels of disease intensity followed by M. acuminata subsp. burmannica. Some individuals of M. yunnanensis, M. nagensium, M. ruiliensis and M. velutina showed low levels of rhizome discolouration in greenhouse conditions, but were resistant in the field. No symptoms were observed on M. basjoo and M. itinerans, suggesting higher levels of resistance to Foc-TR4. The results revealed different sources of resistance to Foc-TR4 in banana wild relatives, which constitute a valuable genetic resource for banana breeding programmes aiming to produce cultivars resistant to fusarium wilt.},

ABSTRACT Biological control of tomato wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici by rhizobacteria Replacing the intensive use of pesticides for alternative methods in disease control has been an important aim for agricultural research. Rhizobacteria are known to be capable of reducing diseases levels in many crops and also of promoting plant growth. The objective of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of six pre-selected rhizobacteria isolates in controlling Ralstonia solanacearum and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (FOL) under controlled conditions in a greenhouse, and to link such capacity to the " in vitro " production of selected biologically active compounds. The ability of these rhizobacteria isolates to produce chitinases, amylases, lipases, antibiotic compounds was investigated. Additionally, their ability in solubilizing phosphate was also checked. Microbiolization of seeds with one rhizobacterium DFs1421 (Pseudomonas sp.) reduced the tomato wilt AUDPC in both assays (36.6 and 91.7{\%} in the first and second assays respectively). Such efficacy in wilt control is likely to be linked with the production of antibiotics as observed " in vitro " . Streptomyces (DFs1296 and DFs1315) and Bacillus (DFs1414), and the chemical inducer (ASM) reduced significantly fusarium wilt ranging 22.5 to 76{\%}. This may be owing to the observed chitinolytic activity and / or antibiosis in the presence of volatile compounds.},

abstract = {Changes in temperature, CO2, and precipitation under the scenarios of climate change for the next 30 yr present a challenge to crop production. This review focuses on the impact of temperature, CO2, and ozone on agronomic crops and the implications for crop production. Understanding these implications for agricultural crops is critical for developing cropping systems resilient to stresses induced by climate change. There is variation among crops in their response to CO2, temperature, and precipitation changes and, with the regional differences in predicted climate, a situation is created in which the responses will be further complicated. For example, the temperature effects on soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] could potentially cause yield reductions of 2.4{\%} in the South but an increase of 1.7{\%} in the Midwest. The frequency of years when temperatures exceed thresholds for damage during critical growth stages is likely to increase for some crops and regions. The increase in CO2 contributes significantly to enhanced plant growth and improved water use efficiency (WUE); however, there may be a downscaling of these positive impacts due to higher temperatures plants will experience during their growth cycle. A challenge is to understand the interactions of the changing climatic parameters because of the interactions among temperature, CO2, and precipitation on plant growth and development and also on the biotic stresses of weeds, insects, and diseases. Agronomists will have to consider the variations in temperature and precipitation as part of the production system if they are to ensure the food security required by an ever increasing population.},

In 449' and 'Kalyansona' the increase in grain yield of individual ear of plants grown under elevated CO2 concentration was due to an increase in individual grain weight. In 'HD 4502', an increase in grain yield of individual ear of plants grown under elevated CO2 concentration was due to higher grain number/ear as a result of increase in spikelets/ear. Genotypic differences in responses to elevated CO2 were observed. Varieties having greater sink capacity in terms of higher grains/ear showed a greater yield response in both tetraploid and hexaploid wheat.},

abstract = {Secreted-in-xylem (SIX) proteins of the vascular wilt pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici are secreted during infection of tomato and function in virulence or avirulence. E oxysporum formae speciales have specific host ranges but the roles of SIX proteins in diverse hosts are unknown. We identified homologs of E oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici SIX1, SIX4, SIX8, and SIX9 in the genome of Arabidopsis infecting isolate Fo5176. A SIX4 homolog (termed Fo5176-SIX4) differed from that of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol-SIX4) by only two amino acids, and its expression was induced during infection of Arabidopsis. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing Fo5176-SIX4 had increased disease symptoms with Fo5176. Conversely, Fo5176-SIX4 gene knock-out mutants (Delta six4) had significantly reduced virulence on Arabidopsis, and this was associated with reduced fungal biomass and host jasmonate-mediated gene expression, the latter known to be essential for host symptom development. Full virulence was restored by complementation of Delta six4 mutants with either Fo5176-SIX4 or Fol-SIX4. Thus, Fo5176-SIX4 contributes quantitatively to virulence on Arabidopsis whereas, in tomato, Fol-SIX4 acts in host specificity as both an avirulence protein and a suppressor of other race-specific resistances. The strong sequence conservation for SIX4 in E oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici and Fo5176 suggests a recent common origin.},

abstract = {Elevation in atmospheric CO2 concentration broadly affects plant phenology and physiology, and these effects may alter the performance of plant viruses. The effects of elevated CO2 on the susceptibility of tomato plants to Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) were examined for two successive years in open top chambers (OTC) in the field. We experimentally tested the hypothesis that elevated CO2 would reduce the incidence and severity of TYLCV on tomato by altering plant defence strategies. Our results showed that elevated CO2 decreased TYLCV disease incidence (by 14.6{\%} in 2009 and 11.8{\%} in 2010) and decreased disease severity (by 20.0{\%} in 2009 and 10.4{\%} in 2010). Elevated CO2 also decreased the level of TYLCV coat protein in tomato leaves. Regardless of virus infection, elevated CO2 increased plant height and aboveground biomass. Additionally, elevated CO2 increased the leaf C:N ratio of tomato, but decreased soluble protein content in leaves. Notably, elevated CO2 increased the salicylic acid (SA) level in uninfected and infected plants. In contrast, elevated CO2 reduced jasmonic acid (JA) in uninfected plants while it increased JA and abscisic acid (ABA) in virus-infected plants. Furthermore, combined exogenous SA and JA application enhanced resistance to TYLCV more than application of either SA or JA alone. Our results suggest that the modulated antagonistic relationship between SA and JA under elevated CO2 makes a great contribution to increased tomato resistance to TYLCV, and the predicted increases in tomato productivity may be enhanced by reduced plant virus susceptibility under projected rising CO2 conditions.},

abstract = {The use of genetically modified crops expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins can lead to the reduction in application of broad-spectrum pesticides and an increased opportunity for supplementary biological control. Bt microbial sprays are also used by organic growers or as part of integrated pest management programs that rely on the use of natural enemies. In both applications the evolution of resistance to Bt toxins is a potential problem. Natural enemies (pathogens or insects) acting in combination with toxins can accelerate or decelerate the evolution of resistance to Bt. In the present study we investigated whether the use of a nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) could potentially affect the evolution of resistance to the Bt toxin Cry1Ac in Plutella xylostella. At low toxin doses there was evidence for antagonistic interactions between AcMNPV and Cry1Ac resistant and susceptible insects. However, this antagonism was much stronger and more widespread for susceptible larvae; interactions were generally not distinguishable from additive for resistant larvae. Selection for resistance to Cry1Ac in two populations of P. xylostella with differing resistance mechanisms did not produce any correlated changes in resistance to AcMNPV. Stronger antagonistic interactions between Bt and AcMNPV on susceptible rather than resistant larvae can decrease the relative fitness between Bt-resistant and susceptible larvae. These interactions and the lack of cross-resistance between virus and toxin suggest that the use of NPV is compatible with resistance management to Bt products. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

This integration allows readers to both verify and adapt the claims in the documents. Authors can easily reproduce the results in the future, and they can present the document's contents in a different medium, for example, with interactive controls. This article describes a software framework for both authoring and distributing these integrated, dynamic documents that contain text, code, data, and any auxiliary content needed to recreate the computations. The documents are dynamic in that the contents - including figures, tables, and so on - can be recalculated each time a view of the document is generated. Our model treats a dynamic document as a master or "source" document from which one can generate different views in the form of traditional, derived documents for different audiences. We introduce the concept of a compendium as a container for one or more dynamic documents and the different elements needed when processing them, such as code and data. The compendium serves as a means for distributing, managing, and updating the collection. The step from disseminating analyses via a compendium to reproducible research is a small one. By reproducible research, we mean research papers with accompanying software tools that allow the reader to directly reproduce the results and employ the computational methods that are presented in the research paper. Some of the issues involved in paradigms for the production, distribution, and use of such reproducible research are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Statistical Association, Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and Interface Foundation of North America.},

abstract = {While photosynthesis of C3 plants is stimulated by an increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration, photosynthetic capacity is often reduced after long-term exposure to elevated CO2. This reduction appears to be brought about by end product inhibition, resulting from an imbalance in the supply and demand of carbohydrates. A review of the literature revealed that the reduction of photosynthetic capacity in elevated CO2 was most pronounced when the increased supply of carbohydrates was combined with small sink size. The volume of pots in which plants were grown affected the sink size by restricting root growth. While plants grown in small pots had a reduced photosynthetic capacity, plants grown in the field showed no reduction or an increase in this capacity. Pot volume also determined the effect of elevated CO2 on the root/shoot ratio: the root/shoot ratio increased when root growth was not restricted and decreased in plants grown in small pots. The data presented in this paper suggest that plants growing in the field will maintain a high photosynthetic capacity as the atmospheric CO2 level continues to rise.},

abstract = {Increasing population and consumption are placing unprecedented demands on agriculture and natural resources. Today, approximately a billion people are chronically malnourished while our agricultural systems are concurrently degrading land, water, biodiversity and climate on a global scale. To meet the world's future food security and sustainability needs, food production must grow substantially while, at the same time, agriculture's environmental footprint must shrink dramatically. Here we analyse solutions to this dilemma, showing that tremendous progress could be made by halting agricultural expansion, closing 'yield gaps' on underperforming lands, increasing cropping efficiency, shifting diets and reducing waste. Together, these strategies could double food production while greatly reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture.},

abstract = {Elevated levels of atmospheric CO2are predicted to contribute to major climatic changes during the next 50–100 years. This can have a significant impact on future food security if such changes make crop plants vulnerable to biotic and abiotic stresses. Indeed, a growing body of recent studies highlighted in this review show that elevated CO2(eCO2) directly and/or indirectly influence plant-biotic interactions. In many instances, eCO2alters phytohormone and reactive oxygen signalling, secondary metabolism as well as defence-associated development such as stomatal responses in the host. eCO2can also directly and/or indirectly influence pathogenesis- and herbivory-related traits in pest and pathogen populations although currently very little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in such effects. In addition, eCO2alters predator-prey interactions by interfering with indirect defences and chemical communications in insect pests. A better understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in plant-biotic interactions under eCO2will be critical towards mitigation of potentially adverse effects of climate change on crop production.},

abstract = {Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a trichothecene mycotoxin commonly produced by Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum during infection of cereal plants, such as wheat and barley. This toxin is a fungal virulence factor that facilitates the development of Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease. Wheat cultivar (cv.) Remus is susceptible to DON; the toxin causes premature bleaching of spikelets and inhibits root growth. This study used custom-made wheat cDNA arrays to analyse the effect of DON on the transcriptome of heads of the toxin-sensitive wheat cv. Remus at both 4 and 24 h post-toxin treatment. DON-induced transcripts encoded an array of proteins collectively associated with a range of cellular functions, such as metabolite transformation and detoxification, the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway, jasmonate biosynthesis and signalling, carbohydrate metabolism, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. This study is the first to demonstrate that the fungal virulence factor DON modulates jasmonate biosynthesis and signalling. It also highlights the fact that the toxin-mediated accumulation of transcripts associated with metabolite transformation and detoxification, proteolysis and phenylpropanoid accumulation is not unique to DON-resistant wheat genotypes. Therefore, the respective encoded proteins are likely part of the general wheat defence against DON. Comparative analysis of the results of this and other studies suggests that it is likely to be the rapidity and magnitude rather than the components of the response that are critical in determining resistance to DON and thus the spread of FHB disease in wheat heads.},

In recent decades, advances in crop breeding, farming practice and the agrochemical industry have allowed crop yields to keep pace with food demand. In this opinion article, we speculate on which recent technological advances will allow us to maintain this situation into the future. We take inspiration that it is 25 y since the first plant disease resistance genes were cloned, and imagine if and how agricultural control of pathogens will be achieved by the year 2044. We examine which technologies are best poised to make the jump from lab bench to field application, and propose that future control measures will likely depend on effective integrated disease management.},

abstract = {Outbreaks of infectious diseases require a rapid response from policy makers. The choice of an adequate level of response relies upon available knowledge of the spatial and temporal parameters governing pathogen spread, affecting, amongst others, the predicted severity of the epidemic. Yet, when a new pathogen is introduced into an alien environment, such information is often lacking or of no use, and epidemiological parameters must be estimated from the first observations of the epidemic. This poses a challenge to epidemiologists: how quickly can the parameters of an emerging disease be estimated? How soon can the future progress of the epidemic be reliably predicted? We investigate these issues using a unique, spatially and temporally resolved dataset for the invasion of a plant disease, Asiatic citrus canker in urban Miami. We use epidemiological models, Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo, and advanced spatial statistical methods to analyse rates and extent of spread of the disease. A rich and complex epidemic behaviour is revealed. The spatial scale of spread is approximately constant over time and can be estimated rapidly with great precision (although the evidence for long-range transmission is inconclusive). In contrast, the rate of infection is characterised by strong monthly fluctuations that we associate with extreme weather events. Uninformed predictions from the early stages of the epidemic, assuming complete ignorance of the future environmental drivers, fail because of the unpredictable variability of the infection rate. Conversely, predictions improve dramatically if we assume prior knowledge of either the main environmental trend, or the main environmental events. A contrast emerges between the high detail attained by modelling in the spatiotemporal description of the epidemic and the bottleneck imposed on epidemic prediction by the limits of meteorological predictability. We argue that identifying such bottlenecks will be a fundamental step in future modelling of weather-driven epidemics.},

abstract = {Random amplified polymorphic DNA assays were carried out on a range of isolates of Rhizoctonia cerealis to identify markers common to all isolates. Two fragments were isolated, cloned and used to probe Southern blots of DNA from R. cerealis and isolates from a range of anastomosis groups of Rhizoctonia solani. The two fragments hybridized specifically to DNA of R. cerealis and not to DNA of any of the isolates of R. solani. Both fragments were partially sequenced and two pairs of primers were generated for use in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Amplification of a fragment of the anticipated size occurred following PCR of all isolates of R. cerealis and not from any of a range of fungal species associated with disease of the stem base of cereals. The primer pairs for R. cerealis were also used, along with those for Microdochium nivale and W and R-type of Pseudocercosporell herpotrichoides, to deled these pathogens in extracts from field-grown wheat plants exhibiting symptoms of sharp eyespot, eyespot, foot rot or a combination of the diseases. No relationship was found between visual disease assessment of sharp eyespot at growth stage 37 and the results of PCR However, the results of PCR and visual disease assessment at growth stage 75 were similar, indicating that visual disease assessment may not be reliable until later growth stages. This system offers the potential to detect the presence of R. cerealis in cereals and avoid problems commonly associated with conventional diagnosis of this disease and isolation of the pathogen.},

abstract = {In Northern Europe, changes in climate may result in better growing conditions for many crops. However, the expected warmer and more humid conditions are favourable for Fusarium head blight infections on cereals. The Fusarium species prevalent in Nordic areas to date are the same as in Central Europe: F. avenaceum, F. culmorum, F. graminearum and F. poae. The prevalence of F. graminearum in cereal grain has already increased in Central Europe and is likely to increase in the North due to the expected changes in weather conditions, reduced tillage and the predicted increase in maize cultivation in Nordic countries. The possible weather extremes predispose cereals to Fusarium infections by increasing the populations of insect pests injuring plants. Adverse conditions may even create conditions suitable for F. subglutinans or F. verticilloides to infect maize and possibly other cereals in rotation in southern parts of Scandinavia. The importance of the species that infect in relatively dry conditions, F. langsethiae and F. poae, may also increase on winter cereals which are predicted to be more prevalent in future farming. If the number of crop species cultivated will increase and non-cereal crops are included in rotations effects of reduced tillage on Fusarium infections in grain could be limited. The predicted changes in climate towards 2050 are expected to slightly change Fusarium species composition in Northern Europe. An increase in F. graminearum and possibly the invasion of northern parts of Central Europe and Denmark by fumonisin producers is expected.},

abstract = {Although food prices in major world markets are at or near a historical low, there is increasing concern about food security—the ability of the world to provide healthy and environmentally sustainable diets for all its peoples. This article is an introduction to a collection of reviews whose authors were asked to explore the major drivers affecting the food system between now and 2050. A first set of papers explores the main factors affecting the demand for food (population growth, changes in consumption patterns, the effects on the food system of urbanization and the importance of understanding income distributions) with a second examining trends in future food supply (crops, livestock, fisheries and aquaculture, and ‘wild food'). A third set explores exogenous factors affecting the food system (climate change, competition for water, energy and land, and how agriculture depends on and provides ecosystem services), while the final set explores cross-cutting themes (food system economics, food wastage and links with health). Two of the clearest conclusions that emerge from the collected papers are that major advances in sustainable food production and availability can be achieved with the concerted application of current technologies (given sufficient political will), and the importance of investing in research sooner rather than later to enable the food system to cope with both known and unknown challenges in the coming decades.},

abstract = {Several new races of the stripe rust pathogen have become frequent throughout the wheat growing regions of the United States since 2000. These new races are virulent to most of the wheat seedling resistance genes limiting the resistance sources that can be used to combat this pathogen. High-temperature adult-plant (HTAP) stripe rust resistance has proven to be more durable than seedling resistance due to its non-race-specific nature, but its use is limited by the lack of mapping information. We report here the identification of a new HTAP resistance gene from Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides (DIC) designated as Yr36. Lines carrying this gene were susceptible to almost all the stripe rust pathogen races tested at the seedling stage but showed adult-plant resistance to the prevalent races in California when tested at high diurnal temperatures. Isogenic lines for this gene were developed by six backcross generations. Field tests in two locations showed increased levels of field resistance to stripe rust and increased yields in isogenic lines carrying the Yr36 gene compared to those without the gene. Recombinant substitution lines of chromosome 6B from DIC in the isogenic background of durum cv. Langdon were used to map the Yr36 gene on the short arm of chromosome 6B completely linked to Xbarc101, and within a 2-cM interval defined by PCR-based markers Xucw71 and Xbarc136. Flanking locus Xucw71 is also closely linked to the grain protein content locus Gpc-B1 (0.3-cM). Marker-assisted selection strategies are presented to improve stripe rust resistance and simultaneously select for high or low Gpc-B1 alleles.},

abstract = {Horizontal transfer (HT), or the passage of genetic material between non-mating species, is increasingly recognized as an important force in the evolution of eukaryotic genomes(1,2). Transposons, with their inherent ability to mobilize and amplify within genomes, may be especially prone to HT3-7. However, the means by which transposons can spread across widely diverged species remain elusive. Here we present evidence that host-parasite interactions have promoted the HT of four transposon families between invertebrates and vertebrates. We found that Rhodnius prolixus, a triatomine bug feeding on the blood of various tetrapods and vector of Chagas' disease in humans, carries in its genome four distinct transposon families that also invaded the genomes of a diverse, but overlapping, set of tetrapods. The bug transposons are similar to 98{\%} identical and cluster phylogenetically with those of the opossum and squirrel monkey, two of its preferred mammalian hosts in South America. We also identified one of these transposon families in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, a cosmopolitan vector of trematodes infecting diverse vertebrates, whose ancestral sequence is nearly identical and clusters with those found in Old World mammals. Together these data provide evidence for a previously hypothesized role of host-parasite interactions in facilitating HT among animals(3,7). Furthermore, the large amount of DNA generated by the amplification of the horizontally transferred transposons supports the idea that the exchange of genetic material between hosts and parasites influences their genomic evolution.},

abstract = {Spatial extrapolation of cropping systems models for regional crop growth and water use assessment and farm-level precision management has been limited by the vast model input requirements and the model sensitivity to parameter uncertainty. Remote sensing has been proposed as a viable source of spatial information for guiding model simulations, but techniques for merging remote sensing with cropping systems models have not been rigorously explored. We developed and tested two techniques for assimilation of remotely sensed green leaf area index (GLAI) into the CSM-CROPSIM-CERES-Wheat model: one based on model "updating" and the other based on model "forcing". A dataset from two wheat irrigation scheduling experiments, conducted at Maricopa, Arizona, during the winters of 2003-2004 and 2004-2005, provided canopy spectral reflectance information and measurements of canopy weight, wheat yield, and evapotranspiration (ET) under varying planting densities and nitrogen rates for testing the ability of the assimilation techniques to improve model simulations. Monte Carlo simulation methods were used to assess the performance of GLAI data assimilation in light of uncertainty in the model parameters that govern the GLAI simulation. When considering this uncertainty, assimilation of GLAI by "updating" and by "forcing" was able to reduce error between measured and simulated canopy weight and ET by 43.6{\%} and 56.5{\%} and by 45.0{\%} and 51.6{\%}, respectively, as compared to the stand-alone model. The assimilation techniques had greater difficulty improving wheat yield simulations because simulated yield was more sensitive to parameters other than GLAI, especially in the 2004-2005 growing season. Assimilation of remotely sensed data into cropping systems models has potential to improve simulations of key model outputs, such as canopy weight and ET, but further efforts are warranted to explore and fine-tune techniques for merging these two technologies.},

abstract = {The re-emergence of fusarium head blight throughout the world and especially in Western Europe prompted a survey of the situation in the Netherlands. To allow for a high throughput screening of large numbers of samples, a diagnostic PCR method was developed to detect the most common species of Fusarium occurring on wheat. Seven primer pairs were tested for their ability to identify isolates of Fusarium avenaceum, F. culmorum, F. graminearum, F. poae, F. proliferatum and Microdochium nivale var. majus and M. nivale var. nivale. Each primer pair only generated a PCR product with the corresponding Fusarium species and all PCR fragments had different molecular sizes. This allowed the generation of these amplicons using a mixture of all seven primer pairs. The robustness of this multiplex PCR encouraged us to screen a large series of isolates collected in 2000 and 2001. In both years 40 fields were sampled leading to a collection of 209 isolates from 2000 and 145 isolates from 2001. The results of the multiplex PCR demonstrated that F. graminearum was the most abundant species in the Fusarium complex on wheat in both years. This is in sharp contrast to reports from the 1980s and early 1990s, which found F. culmorum as the predominant species. Primers derived from the tri7 and tri13 genes, which are implicated in the acetylation and oxygenation of the C-4 atom of the backbone of the trichothecene molecule, were used to discriminate between deoxynivalenol and nivalenol (NIV) producers. The populations of F. culmorum and F. graminearum both showed a slight increase in NIV-producers in 2001.},

abstract = {Changes in the incidence and onset of potato late-blight epidemics in Finland were investigated and compared with possible changes in climate, presence of soil-borne inoculum, and aggressiveness of Phytophthora infestans populations. Datasets were constructed from leaf blight assessments in cultivar trials or fungicide tests carried out at eight experimental sites during the periods 1933-1962 and 1983-2002. Additional data were obtained from late-blight monitoring projects carried out from 1991 to 2002. From 1998 to 2002, the risk of blight outbreak was 17-fold higher compared with the periods 1933-62 and 1983-1997. Simultaneously, the outbreaks of the epidemics began 2-4 weeks earlier. The changes observed were associated with a climate more conducive to blight in the late 1990s. Lack of rotation also advanced blight epidemics by an average of 9 days in 1998-2002, but it did not have this effect in 1992-1997, suggesting that soil borne inoculum may not have been a significant threat to potato until the late 1990s. The aggressiveness of the P. infestans isolates seemed to have only minor effect on the onset of the epidemics after 1991, as the apparent infection rate remained unchanged despite weather conditions more favourable to late blight in the late 1990s. As a consequence of the more frequent and earlier epidemics, the sales of fungicides used against late blight in Finland increased 4-fold from the 1980s to 2002.},

abstract = {Abstract The long-term effects of conservation management practices on greenhouse gas fluxes from tropical/subtropical croplands remain to be uncertain. Using both manual and automatic sampling chambers, we measured N2O and CH4 fluxes at a long-term experimental site (1968–present) in Queensland, Australia from 2006 to 2009. Annual net greenhouse gas fluxes (NGGF) were calculated from the 3-year mean N2O and CH4 fluxes and the long-term soil organic carbon changes. N2O emissions exhibited clear daily, seasonal and interannual variations, highlighting the importance of whole-year measurement over multiple years for obtaining temporally representative annual emissions. Averaged over 3 years, annual N2O emissions from the unfertilized and fertilized soils (90 kg N ha−1 yr−1 as urea) amounted to 138 and 902 g N ha−1, respectively. The average annual N2O emissions from the fertilized soil were 388 g N ha−1 lower under no-till (NT) than under conventional tillage (CT) and 259 g N ha−1 higher under stubble retention (SR) than under stubble burning (SB). Annual N2O emissions from the unfertilized soil were similar between the contrasting tillage and stubble management practices. The average emission factors of fertilizer N were 0.91{\%}, 1.20{\%}, 0.52{\%} and 0.77{\%} for the CT-SB, CT-SR, NT-SB and NT-SR treatments, respectively. Annual CH4 fluxes from the soil were very small (−200–300 g CH4 ha−1 yr−1) with no significant difference between treatments. The NGGF were 277–350 kg CO2-e ha−1 yr−1 for the unfertilized treatments and 401–710 kg CO2-e ha−1 yr−1 for the fertilized treatments. Among the fertilized treatments, N2O emissions accounted for 52–97{\%} of NGGF and NT-SR resulted in the lowest NGGF (401 kg CO2-e ha−1 yr−1 or 140 kg CO2-e t−1 grain). Therefore, NT-SR with improved N fertilizer management practices was considered the most promising management regime for simultaneously achieving maximal yield and minimal NGGF.},

Multiple alignment of translation elongation factor (TEF) gene sequences of different Fusarium spp., showed a deletion of six nucleotides in F. fujikuroi sequence and a two nucleotide polymorphism in the same region of F. proliferatum sequence. These elements of variability were used to develop a conventional and Real-Time PCR assay for diagnosis. The species specific primer pairs (Fuji1F/TEF1R and Proli1F/TEF1R) gave a product of 179 and 188 bp for F. fujikuroi and F. proliferatum respectively. Primer specificity was confirmed by analyzing the DNA of the most representative species of the GFSC and 298 strains of Fusarium spp. isolated from rice plants and seeds in Italy.

abstract = {Fungal spores and mycelium fragments are particles which become and remain airborne and have been subjects of aerobiological studies. The presence and the abundance of taxa in aerobiological samples can be very variable and impaired by changeable climatic conditions. Because many fungi produce mycotoxins and both their mycelium fragments and spores are potential allergens, monitoring the presence of these taxa is of key importance. So far data on exposure and sensitization to fungal allergens are mainly based on the assessment of few, easily identifiable taxa and focused only on certain environments. The microscopic method used to analyze aerobiological samples and the inconspicuous fungal characters do not allow a in depth taxonomical identification. Here, we present a first assessment of fungal diversity from airborne samples using a DNA metabarcoding analysis. The nuclear ITS2 region was selected as barcode to catch fungal diversity in mixed airborne samples gathered during two weeks in four sites of North-Eastern and Central Italy. We assessed the taxonomic composition and diversity within and among the sampled sites and compared the molecular data with those obtained by traditional microscopy. The molecular analyses provide a tenfold more comprehensive determination of the taxa than the traditional morphological inspections. Our results prove that the metabarcoding analysis is a promising approach to increases quality and sensitivity of the aerobiological monitoring. The laboratory and bioinformatic workflow implemented here is now suitable for routine, high-throughput, regional analyses of airborne fungi.},

abstract = {Background and Aims Crop protection strategies, based on preventing quantitative crop losses rather than pest outbreaks, are being developed as a promising way to reduce fungicide use. The Bastiaans' model was applied to winter wheat crops (Triticum aestivum) affected by leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) and Septoria tritici blotch (STB; Mycosphaerella graminicola) under a range of crop management conditions. This study examined (a) whether green leaf area per layer accurately accounts for growth loss; and (b) whether from growth loss it is possible to derive yield loss accurately and simply. Methods Over 5 years of field experiments, numerous green leaf area dynamics were analysed during the post-anthesis period on wheat crops using natural aerial epidemics of leaf rust and STB. Key Results When radiation use efficiency (RUE) was derived from bulk green leaf area index (GLAI), RUEbulk was hardly accurate and exhibited large variations among diseased wheat crops, thus extending outside the biological range. In contrast, when RUE was derived from GLAI loss per layer, RUElayer was a more accurate calculation and fell within the biological range. In one situation out of 13, no significant shift in the RUElayer of diseased crops vs. healthy crops was observed. A single linear relationship linked yield to post-anthesis accumulated growth for all treatments. Its slope, not different from 1, suggests that the allocation of post-anthesis photosynthates to grains was not affected by the late occurring diseases under study. The mobilization of pre-anthesis reserves completely accounted for the intercept value. Conclusions The results strongly suggest that a simple model based on green leaf area per layer and pre-anthesis reserves can predict both growth and yield of wheat suffering from late epidemics of foliar diseases over a range of crop practices. It could help in better understanding how crop structure and reserve management contribute to tolerance of wheat genotypes to leaf diseases.},

abstract = {This article reviews and analyzes the literature on Yellow dwarf viruses (YDVs) in Australia, examining the range of environmental and climatic factors that explain the observed geographical distribution of the virus and its vectors. BYDV-PAV, vectored mainly by the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi, is the most prevalent YDV species in wheat and grasslands across all states, except Queensland. BYDV-RMV, vectored mainly by Rhopalosiphum maidis, dominates in Queensland grasslands, with very low incidence in wheat. Queensland experiences higher rainfall and warmer temperatures than southern Australia. Across Australia disease incidence in wheat is generally low (around 10 {\%}) and varies from year to year, with the highest incidence found on occasion in Western Australia (up to 52 {\%}) and the lowest in Queensland ({\textless} 1 {\%}). Across Australia there is a much higher virus incidence and more variation in YDV species present in grasslands than in wheat, although in general BYDV-PAV still dominates. An overview of the differences between the YDV species in terms of symptoms, impacts, frequency, transmission rates and geographical distribution is necessary to appreciate the implications of virus spread across Australia, as well as the risks from the interaction of YDV with more recently introduced wheat pathogens. This overview is set in the context of a changing climate, with a discussion of the possible implications of anthropogenic climate change for future epidemics. For example, increasing temperatures in the future may result in more rapid transmission of the virus in the cooler months than at present, with implications for winter crops such as wheat, where YDV currently does most damage. Also, there is potential for the spread of BYDV-RMV further south, as changes in climatic conditions alter both the transmission potential of the virus as well as the vectoring potential by the aphids R. padi and R. maidis. Finally, critical knowledge gaps are identified, highlighting a need for ongoing seasonal monitoring of the virus and vectors to support the use of simulation models to predict the incidence of YDVs in near real-time.},

abstract = {Climate change will probably influence the occurrence, prevalence and severity of plant diseases. This will also affect disease management with regard to timing, preference and efficacy of chemical, physical and biological measures of control and their utilization within integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. Prediction of future requirements in disease management is of great interest for agroindustries, extension services and practical farmers. A comprehensive analysis of potential climate-change effects on disease control is difficult because current knowledge is limited and fragmented. This review reveals that certain existing preventive plant protection measures, such as use of a diversity of crop species in cropping systems, adjustment of sowing or planting dates, use of crop cultivars with superior resistance and/or tolerance to diseases and abiotic stress, use of reliable tools to forecast disease epidemics, application of IPM strategies, and effective quarantine systems, may become particularly important in the future. Effective crop protection technologies are available and will provide appropriate tools to adapt to altered climatic conditions, although the complexity of future risks for plant disease management may be considerable, particularly if new crops are introduced in an area. Overall, the challenge of adapting disease control measures to climate change is not likely to be fundamentally different from the adjustments to technological innovations or changes in the economic framework already required in current crop protection. Potential beneficial effects of climate change, such as longer growing seasons, fewer frosts and shifted precipitation patterns, must not be neglected, as they could counteract the presumed enhancement of particular diseases.},

abstract = {The literature on the importance of plant pathogens sometimes emphasizes their possible role in historical food shortages and even in famines. Aside from such major crises, plant pathogens should also be seen as important reducers of crop performances, with impacts on system sustainability, from the ecological, agronomical, social, and economic standpoints – all contributing ultimately to affecting food security. These views need reconciliation in order to produce a clearer picture of the multidimensional effects of plant disease epidemics. Such a picture is needed for disease management today, but would also be useful for future policies. This article attempts to develop a framework that would enable assessment of the impacts of plant diseases, referred collectively to as crop health, on food security via its components. We have combined three different existing definitions of food security in order to develop a framework consisting of the following six components: (1) Availability. Primary production; (2) Availability. Import - Stockpiles; (3) Access. Physical and supply chain; (4) Access. Economic; (5) Stability of food availability; (6) Utility-Safety-Quality-Nutritive value. In this framework, components of food security are combined with three attributes of production situations: the nature of the considered crop (i.e. food- or non-food), the structure of farms (i.e. subsistence or commercial), and the structure of markets (i.e. weakly organized and local, to strongly organized and globalized). The resulting matrix: [Food security components] × [Attributes of production situations] provides a framework where the impacts of chronic, acute, and emerging plant disease epidemics on food security can be examined. We propose that, given the number of components and interactions at play, a systems modelling approach is required to address the functioning of food systems exposed to plant disease risks. This approach would have application in both the management of the current attrition of crop performances by plant diseases, and also of possible disease-induced shocks. Such an approach would also enable quantifying shifts in disease vulnerability of production situations, and therefore, of food systems, as a result of climate change, globalization, and evolving crop health.},

abstract = {Tillage intensity affects soil microbiological activity in many ways, often driven by changes in soil organic C (SOC) content. The magnitude and direction of those changes, however, depends on inherent (e.g., soil type and texture), experimental (e.g., study duration and sampling depth) and agronomic factors (e.g., cropping system and crop residue management). This nationwide meta-analysis examines published effects of chisel plowing (CP), no-tillage (NT), and perennial cropping systems (PER) relative to moldboard plow (MP) on seven soil health indicators: SOC, microbial biomass C (MBC), microbial biomass N (MBN), soil respiration (Resp), active-C (AC), beta-glucosidase activity (BG) and soil protein (Prot) within four soil depth increments in 302 studies from throughout the United States (U.S.). Overall, converting from MP to CP primarily affected topsoil (0 to ≤ 15 cm) SOC, MBC, and Resp, whereas converting from MP to NT significantly increased all seven soil health indicators in the topsoil. Below the topsoil, NT had greater MBC, MBN, Resp, and BG relative to MP (i.e., 15 to 25-cm). The impact of NT was affected by latitude, soil order, time under NT, and cropping system. Among soil orders, management practices had the largest positive effects in Ultisols, Inceptisols, Alfisols, and Mollisols. Those effects were most noticeable at lower latitudes, in systems that included cover crops or residue retention, and in experiments conducted for at least three years. Perennial systems had a positive effect on all soil health indicators at all soil depths (0 to {\textgreater}40-cm). The positive response of PER systems compared to MP was enhanced at lower latitudes and in Alfisols, Inceptisols, Entisols, and Mollisols. Based on this meta-analysis, reducing tillage intensity, planting cover crop and/or minimizing crop residue removal within annual cropping systems can significantly improve soil biological health in the U.S. Finally, we demonstrate that SOC and many other biological indicators are sensitive to management practices, confirming their utility in soil health assessment.},

Acquisition and transmission experiments were run in parallel in two phytotrons (P1 and P2). Euscelidius variegatus and daisy were used as chrysanthemum yellows hosts, Scaphoideus titanus and broad bean as 'flavescence doree' hosts. Phytoplasma concentration was measured three times in insects and four in plants, at different days after acquisition and inoculation, respectively. Latent period in the vector was also evaluated for both phytoplasmas under the two conditions. On average, phytoplasma multiplication was faster under cooler conditions in insects (P1, 18-22 degrees C; CO(2) 400 ppm) and under warmer conditions in plants (P2, 22-26 degrees C; CO(2) 800 ppm). An influence of T and CO(2) concentrations was observed for chrysanthemum yellows latency in the vector only. Results suggest that T and CO(2) influence on phytoplasma multiplication is host-dependent.},

Fusarium species found on grain in this study according to Leslie and Summerell (1) can produce DON, NIV, ZEN, fumonisins (FUM), beauvericin (BEA), diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS), HT-2 toxin (HT2), T-2 toxin (T2), moniliformin (MON), and a range of other less investigated toxins (1). Exposure to these toxins can seriously affect human or animal health (5- 7, 17, 32-34). ZEN is an immunotoxic, haematotoxic, hepatotoxic, and genotoxic oestrogenic toxin (32) which can cause infertility, hyperoestrogenism or poor performance in domesticated animals (7,32), and has been implicated in hyperoestrogenic syndromes in humans (32). MON is a cytotoxic and haematotoxic toxin which can cause poor performance in livestock or mortality in animals (7), and has been suspected as a cause of human heart disorder known as Keshan disease (7). BEA is cytotoxic and can cause apoptosis of murine and human cell lines (7). FUM is a cancer-promoting hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic toxin (5, 6), and can cause fatal animal diseases like leukoencephalomalacia in horses and pulmonary oedema in swine (5). Trichothecenes like DON, NIV, DAS, HT2, or T2 are haematotoxic,cytotoxic, immunotoxic and embryotoxic (7, 33), and can cause reduced growth, postnatal mortality, foetal skeleton abnormalities, leucopenia, intrauterine growth retardation, pulmonary adenomas, or epithelial hyperplasia in animals (33, 34).},

abstract = {Background and Aims The problem of increasing CO2 concentration [CO2] and associated climate change has [CO2] on plants. While variation in growth and productivity is generated much interest in modelling effects of closely related to the amount of intercepted radiation, largely determined by leaf area index (LAI), effects of elevated [CO2] on growth are primarily via stimulation of leaf photosynthesis. Variability in LAI depends on climatic and growing conditions including [CO2] concentration and can be high, as is known for agricultural crops which are specifically emphasized in this report. However, modelling photosynthesis has received much attention and photosynthesis is often represented inadequately detailed in plant productivity models. Less emphasis has been placed on the modelling of leaf area dynamics, and relationships between plant growth, elevated [CO2] and LAI are not well understood. This Botanical Briefing aims at clarifying the relative importance of LAI for canopy assimilation and growth in biomass under conditions of rising [CO2] and discusses related implications for process-based modelling. Model A simulation exercise performed for a wheat crop demonstrates recent experimental findings about canopy assimilation as affected by LAI and elevation of [CO2]. While canopy assimilation largely increases with LAI below canopy light saturation, effects on canopy assimilation of [CO2] elevation are less pronounced and tend to decline as LAI increases. Results from selected model-testing studies indicate that simulation of LAI is often critical and forms an important source of uncertainty in plant productivity models, particularly under conditions of limited resource supply. Conclusions Progress in estimating plant growth and productivity under rising [CO2] is unlikely to be achieved without improving the modelling of LAI. This will depend on better understanding of the processes of substrate allocation, leaf area development and senescence, and the role of LAI in controlling plant adaptation to environmental changes.

abstract = {Relationships between weather, agronomic factors and wheat disease abundance were examined to determine possible causes of variability on century time scales. In archived samples of wheat grain and leaves obtained from the Rothamsted Broadbalk experiment archive (1844-2003), amounts of wheat, Phaeosphaeria nodorum and Mycosphaerella graminicola DNA were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Relationships between amounts of pathogens and environmental and agronomic factors were examined by multiple regression. Wheat DNA decayed at approx. 1{\%} yr(-1) in stored grain. No M. graminicola DNA was detected in grain samples. Fluctuations in amounts of P. nodorum in grain were related to changes in spring rainfall, summer temperature and national SO2 emission. Differences in amounts of P. nodorum between grain and leaf were related to summer temperature and spring rainfall. In leaves, annual variation in spring rainfall affected both pathogens similarly, but SO2 had opposite effects. Previous summer temperature had a highly significant effect on M. graminicola. Cultivar effects were significant only at P = 0.1. Long-term variation in P. nodorum and M. graminicola DNA in leaf and grain over the period 1844-2003 was dominated by factors related to national SO2 emissions. Annual variability was dominated by weather factors occurring over a period longer than the growing season.},

abstract = {A high-throughput and reliable seedling bioassay to screen wheat germplasm for crown rot resistance was developed. Single wheat seedlings were grown in square seedling punnets in a glasshouse and inoculated with a monoconidial Fusarium pseudograminearum isolate 10 days after emergence. The punnets were laid horizontally on their side and a 10-mu L inoculum droplet placed on the stem base. Seedlings were incubated at near-saturated relative humidity, and crown rot severity was assessed 35 days after inoculation. Studies on the duration of incubation period, inoculum concentration and temperature were carried out to optimize these parameters. Seedling growth at 25/15(+/- 5)degrees C in a glasshouse and 48-h incubation at near-saturated RH in darkness gave the best results. When crown rot resistance rankings of 16 Australian cultivars from the bioassay were compared with their field performance, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was highly significant. This indicated that the seedling bioassay mimicked field resistance to crown rot in adult plants. A bootstrap resampling analysis showed little or no improvement in the coefficient of variation with an increasing number of replications, indicating a high level of precision and reproducibility. By detecting small but consistent differences in crown rot severity, the bioassay proved effective in large-scale screening for partial resistance: already over 1400 wheat genotypes have been screened. The high degree of precision makes this an invaluable tool in the understanding of pathogen aggressiveness, host specialization and parasitic fitness.},

abstract = {The spread of aggressive fungal pathogens into previously non-endemic regions is a major threat to plant health and food security. Analyses of the spatial and genetic structure of plant pathogens offer valuable insights into their origin, dispersal mechanisms and evolution, and have been useful to develop successful disease management strategies. Here, we elucidated the genetic diversity, population structure and demographic history of worldwide invasion of the ascomycete Verticillium dahliae, a soil-borne pathogen, using a global collection of 1100 isolates from multiple plant hosts and countries. Seven well-differentiated genetic clusters were revealed through discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC), but no strong associations between these clusters and host/geographic origin of isolates were found. Analyses of clonal evolutionary relationships among multilocus genotypes with the eBURST algorithm and analyses of genetic distances revealed that genetic clusters represented several ancient evolutionary lineages with broad geographic distribution and wide host range. Comparison of different scenarios of demographic history using approximate Bayesian computations revealed the branching order among the different genetic clusters and lineages. The different lineages may represent incipient species, and this raises questions with respect to their evolutionary origin and the factors allowing their maintenance in the same areas and same hosts without evidence of admixture between them. Based on the above findings and the biology of V. dahliae, we conclude that anthropogenic movement has played an important role in spreading V. dahliae lineages. Our findings have implications for the development of management strategies such as quarantine measures and crop resistance breeding.},

Fusarium graminearum infection causes significant crop and quality losses. In addition to roles as virulence factors during pathogenesis, trichothecene mycotoxins (e.g. deoxynivalenol) produced by this pathogen constitute a significant threat to human and animal health if consumed in respective food or feed products. In the last few years, significant progress has been made towards a better understanding of the processes involved in F. graminearum pathogenesis, toxin biosynthesis and host resistance mechanisms through the use of high-throughput genomic and phenomic technologies. In this article, we briefly review these new advances and also discuss how future research can contribute to the development of sustainable plant protection strategies against this important plant pathogen.},

Further, globalization, climate change, increased human mobility, and pathogen and vector evolution have combined to increase the spread of invasive plant pathogens. Early and accurate diagnoses and pathogen surveillance on local, regional, and global scales are necessary to predict outbreaks and allow time for development and application of mitigation strategies. Plant disease diagnostic networks have developed worldwide to address the problems of efficient and effective disease diagnosis and pathogen detection, engendering cooperation of institutions and experts within countries and across national borders. Networking maximizes impact in the face of shrinking government investments in agriculture and diminishing human resource capacity in diagnostics and applied pathology. New technologies promise to improve the speed and accuracy of disease diagnostics and pathogen detection. Widespread adoption of standard operating procedures and diagnostic laboratory accreditation serve to build trust and confidence among institutions.

abstract = {The monitoring of crop production and irrigation at a regional scale can be based on the use of ecosystem process models and remote sensing data. The former simulate the time courses of the main biophysical variables which affect crop photosynthesis and water consumption at a fine time step (hourly or daily); the latter allows to provide the spatial distribution of these variables over a region of interest at a time span from 10 days to a month. In this context, this study investigates the feasibility of using the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from remote sensing data to provide indirect estimates of: (1) the leaf area index (LAI), which is a key-variable of many crop process models; and (2) crop coefficients, which represent the ratio of actual (AET) to reference (ET0) evapotranspiration. A first analysis is performed based on a dataset collected at field in an irrigated area of the Haouz plain (region of Marrakesh, Central Morocco) during the 2002-2003 agricultural season. The seasonal courses of NDVI, LAI, AET and ETO have been compared, then crop coefficients have been calculated using a method that allows roughly to separate soil evaporation from plant transpiration. This allows to compute the crop basal coefficient (K-cb) restricted to the plant transpiration process. Finally, three relationships have been established. The relationships between LAI and NDVI as well as between LAI and Kcb were found both exponential, with associated errors of 30{\%} and 15{\%}, respectively. Because the NDVI saturates at high LAI values ({\textgreater}4), the use of remotely-sensed data results in poor accuracy of LAI estimates for well-developed canopies. However, this inaccuracy was not found critical for transpiration estimates since AET appears limited to ETO for well-developed canopies. As a consequence, the relationship between NDVI and Kcb was found linear and of good accuracy (15{\%}). Based on these relationships, maps of LAI and transpiration requirements have been derived from two Landsat7-ETM+ images acquired at the beginning and the middle of the agricultural season. These maps show the space and time variability in crop development and water requirements over a 3 km x 3 km irrigated area that surrounds the fields of study. They may give an indication on how the water should be distributed over the area of interest in order to improve the efficiency of irrigation. The availability, in the near future, of Earth Observation Systems designed to provide both high spatial resolution (10 m) and frequent revisit (day) would make it feasible to set up such approaches for the operational monitoring of crop phenology and irrigation at a regional scale.

abstract = {This paper reviews the knowledge on effects of climate change on agricultural productivity in Europe and the consequences for policy and research. Warming is expected to lead to a northward expansion of suitable cropping areas and a reduction of the growing period of determinate crops (e.g. cereals), but an increase for indeterminate crops (e.g. root crops). Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations will directly enhance plant productivity and also increase resource use efficiencies. In northern areas climate change may produce positive effects on agriculture through introduction of new crop species and varieties, higher crop production and expansion of suitable areas for crop cultivation. Disadvantages may be an increase in the need for plant protection, the risk of nutrient leaching and the turnover of soil organic matter. In southern areas the disadvantages will predominate. The possible increase in water shortage and extreme weather events may cause lower harvestable yields, higher yield variability and a reduction in suitable areas for traditional crops. These effects may reinforce the current trends of intensification of agriculture in northern and western Europe and extensification in the Mediterranean and southeastern parts of Europe. Policy will have to support the adaptation of European agriculture to climate change by encouraging the flexibility of land use, crop production, farming systems etc. In doing so, it is necessary to consider the multifunctional role of agriculture, and to strike a variable balance between economic, environmental and social functions in different European regions. Policy will also need to be concerned with agricultural strategies to mitigate climate change through a reduction in emissions of methane and nitrous oxide, an increase in carbon sequestration in agricultural soils and the growing of energy crops to substitute fossil energy use. The policies to support adaptation and mitigation to climate change will need to be linked closely to the development of agri-environmental schemes in the European Union Common Agricultural Policy. Research will have further to deal with the effect on secondary factors of agricultural production, on the quality of crop and animal production, of changes in frequency of isolated and extreme weather events on agricultural production, and the interaction with the surrounding natural ecosystems. There is also a need to study combined effects of adaptation and mitigation strategies, and include assessments of the consequences on current efforts in agricultural policy to develop a sustainable agriculture that also preserves environmental and social values in the rural society.

abstract = {Fusarium pseudograminearum (Fp) causes crown rot (CR) on a wide range of winter cereals reducing yield and grain quality in Australia and worldwide. The broad range of host species presents a major challenge for cropping systems, affecting productivity of the barley, wheat, oats and durum wheat industries. The frequency of disease severity and prevalence in Australia has notably increased with the introduction of minimum tillage cropping practices, less frequent precipitation events during the growing season and more frequent heat-waves due to climate change. This has resulted in exacerbation of CR symptoms. For more than 30 years CR has been considered the most significant fungal disease of temperate cereal crops in Queensland and northern New South Wales. In this review, we discuss the disease, the underlying pathogen biology and key control strategies to reduce the impact of this damaging pathogen. While good progress has been made to identify sources of genetic resistance, we also highlight the opportunity to investigate physiological traits for improved water-use efficiency, such as deep root systems or stay-green, which could minimise yield and grain quality losses due to CR.},

Fusarium spp. was isolated from phloem and sapwood of forest trees and composite rhizosphere soil samples collected from highly diversified geographical and climatic regions of the west of Iran and identified based on their morphological characteristics. Only three Fusarium spp. (F. oxysporum, F. solani and F. eumartii) was isolated from roots. F. nygamai, F. graminearum, F. scirpi, F. proliferatum, F. anthophilum, F. longipes and F. chlamydosporum were recovered from soil samples collected from warm and moderately warm regions, while F. culmorum, F. sporotrichioides, F. sambucinum and F. subglutinans were recovered from cold regions. F. solani, F. oxysporum, F. semitectum, F. equiseti, F. verticillioides, F. merismoides and F. avenaceum were present in all climatic regions. In the bark inoculation tests, selected Fusarium strains representing all species were evaluated for their pathogenicity on stems of healthy Prunus amygdalus under greenhouse conditions. Stem rot assessment revealed that F. oxysporum, F. solani and F. eumartii were the most damaging species.},

abstract = {Gibberella zeae, a major cause of cereal scab, can be divided into two chemotypes based on production of the 8-ketotrichothecenes deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol (NIV). We cloned and sequenced a Tri13 homolog from each chemotype. The Tri13 from a NIV chemotype strain (88-1) is located in the trichothecene gene cluster and carries an open reading frame similar to that of Fusarium sporotrichioides, whereas the Tri13 from a DON chemotype strain (H-11) carries several mutations. To confirm the roles of the Tri13 and TK7 genes in trichothecene production by G. zeae, we genetically altered toxin production in 88-1 and H-11. In transgenic strains, the targeted deletion of Tri13 from the genome of 88-1 caused production of DON rather than NIV. Heterologous expression of the 88-1 Tri13 gene alone or in combination with the 88-1 Tri7 gene conferred on H-11 the ability to synthesize NIV; in the latter case, 4-acetylnivalenol (4-ANIV) also was produced. These results suggest that Tri13 and Tri7 are required for oxygenation and acetylation of the oxygen at C-4 during synthesis of NIV and 4-ANIV in G. zeae. These functional analyses of the Tri13 and Tri7 genes provide the first clear evidence for the genetic basis of the DON and NIV chemotypes in G. zeae.},

Some of the cotton seedlings diseases are caused by the seedborne pathogens especially Colletotrichum gossypii South., C. gossypii South. var. cephalosporioides Costa, Fusarium. moniliforme Sheldon, Rhizoctonia. solani Kuhn, and other less frequent seedborne fungi (Ray {\&} McLaughlin, 1942; Klich, 1986; Julliatii {\&} Ruano, 1997) During the routine analysis, using standard blotter test, of the several acid delinted seed samples received by our seed pathology laboratory, no fungal pathogen of known importance was generally detected, but majority of the samples usually yielded F. semitectum Berk. {\&} Rav. in frequencies reaching 70{\%}. Seedling emergence testes in autoclaved sand showed no correlation between the proportion of F. semitectum infected seeds and any disease symptoms (percent seedling emergence, lesions on any seedling part and negative geotropism), but isolations from such lesions, whenever they appeared, mostly yielded F.semitectum. Several species of Fusarium have been isolated from cottonseeds, most reports being about F. moniliforme. In the the United States, Fusarium spp. consisting of F. roseum Schwabe, F. moniliforme, F. oxysporum Schlecht, and F. solani (Mart.) Sacc. were found to be most widely distributed and abundant in state of Mississippi (Davis, 1977) and in the Georgia Plains (Roncadori et al., 1971). Klich (1986) found considerable amounts of F. semitectum along with other species, in the cottonseed samples collected from the southern states of Alabama, Arizona, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, although its incidence and frequency differed from location to location and in different years at the same location depending upon the rainfall and temperature during the growing season. None of these reports however, explores the role of F. semitectum on seed and seedling quality.

abstract = {Climate changes will influence soil organisms both directly (warming) and indirectly (warming and elevated CO2) via changes in quantity and quality of plant-mediated soil C inputs. Elevated atmospheric CO2 commonly stimulates flow of organic C into the soil system, increases root production and exudation, but decreases litter quality. There is little evidence that atmospheric CO2 enrichment will increase total soil organic matter content because greater C flow into soil stimulates the soil food web, often leading to equivalent increases in soil CO2 efflux. Effects of warming on C allocation belowground, on the other hand, will depend largely on the temperature optima of different plant species. Warming is likely to increase the rate of soil organic matter decomposition by stimulating soil heterotrophic respiration, although some degree of acclimatization to warming is likely. Mycorrhizal and N2-fixing relationships are generally enhanced by CO2 enrichment, but effects of warming are highly variable. Data suggest that energy flow through fungal pathways may be enhanced relative to bacterial pathways by both warming and atmospheric CO2 enrichment. Whether the shift toward fungal domination of soils will increase soilborne fungal disease occurrence in the future is still an open question. Plant heat and drought tolerance, along with resistance to pathogens in warmer and wetter soils, may be achieved, to some unknown extent, by exploitation and management of beneficial soil organisms. Further study is needed to develop a more holistic understanding of the effects of climate change on belowground processes.},

In the trial four N-levels (87, 174, 261, 348 kg/ha were applied. The basic fertilizer contained 140 kg/ha P2O5 and 140 kg/ba K2O. Indicator plant was wheat variety Mv-8.

The degree of infection by leaf diseases (Erysiphe graminis, Puccinia triticina), and by stem base diseases (Gaeumannomyces graminis and Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides) was reported in {\%}. The growing N-doses increased essentially the leaf area size, so besides the composition changes in leaf an ideal microclimate was created for the pathogens. With the applied N-doses a significant linear correlation (r=0,8765**) could be recorded between leaf area size and infection by Erysiphe graminis. Between infection by Puccinia triticina and leaf area size also a significant linear correlation (r=0,9435***) was found.

abstract = {Mathematical models provide a rational basis to inform how, where and when to control disease. Assuming an accurate spatially explicit simulation model can be fitted to spread data, it is straightforward to use it to test the performance of a range of management strategies. However, the typical complexity of simulation models and the vast set of possible controls mean that only a small subset of all possible strategies can ever be tested. An alternative approach-optimal control theory-allows the best control to be identified unambiguously. However, the complexity of the underpinning mathematics means that disease models used to identify this optimum must be very simple. We highlight two frameworks for bridging the gap between detailed epidemic simulations and optimal control theory: open-loop and model predictive control. Both these frameworks approximate a simulation model with a simpler model more amenable to mathematical analysis. Using an illustrative example model, we show the benefits of using feedback control, in which the approximation and control are updated as the epidemic progresses. Our work illustrates a new methodology to allow the insights of optimal control theory to inform practical disease management strategies, with the potential for application to diseases of humans, animals and plants. This article is part of the theme issue 'Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: epidemic forecasting and control'. This theme issue is linked with the earlier issue 'Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: approaches and important themes'.},

abstract = {Crop production and climate change affect each other because crop production (1) produces greenhouse gases (GHGs), (2) is affected by climate change, (3) will have to adapt to changed climatic regimes, and (4) has a potential role in mitigating the production of GHGs. Agriculture is not a major producer of GHGs, at less than 10{\%} of Canada's total. Agriculture is a major producer of methane and nitrous oxide (21 and 310 times more effective at heat trapping than CO2, respectively), but a minor producer Of CO2. The impacts on agriculture will come through increased CO2 effects on plant growth, warmer and drier conditions, changes in wind speed, insect and disease pressures, and many more subtle changes resulting from altered interactions among components of crop agro-ecosystems. Predictions are for net increases in world food production as temperature increases become larger. Potential adaptations are (1) management and genetic alterations to crops, (2) legislative changes, (3) policy and economic changes, and (4) adoption of mitigation practices. Mitigation of GHG effects can be through new cropping systems and crops that reduce net GHG production by emitting less nitrous oxide, increasing soil organic matter content, and allowing production of bio-products such as bio-fuels.},

abstract = {Climate change will have direct impacts on fusarium ear blight (FEB) in wheat crops, since weather factors greatly affect epidemics, the relative proportions of species of ear blight pathogens responsible and the production of deoxynivalenol (DON) toxin by two Fusarium species, F. graminearum and F. culmorum. Many established weather-based prediction models do not accurately predict FEB severity in the UK. One weather-based model developed with UK data suggests a slight increase in FEB severity as a direct effect of climate change. However, severity of the disease is likely to increase further due to indirect effects of climate change, such as increased cropping of grain maize, since maize debris is a potent source of inoculum of F. graminearum. To guide strategies for adaptation to climate change, further research on forecasting, management options to reduce mycotoxin production, and breeding for resistant varieties is a high priority for the UK. Adaptation strategies must also consider factors such as tillage regime, wheat cultivar (flowering time and disease resistance) and fungicide use, which also influence the severity of FEB and related toxin production.

abstract = {Tropical and plantation crops include important crops for food security and alternative energy resources. Even so, there are few studies on the impact of climate change on diseases of these crops. Findings from previous studies concerning some climate-change effects on diseases of coffee, sugarcane, eucalyptus, cassava, citrus, banana, pineapple, cashew, coconut and papaya have been summarized to provide a context. By reviewing available methods to evaluate the impact of climate change on diseases of tropical and plantation crops, we present trends for some diseases and their management strategies, identify critical gaps in knowledge, and suggest experimental and analytical approaches to advance knowledge. As the projected climate conditions will probably vary greatly in the future from continent to continent and from developed to developing countries, studies must be conducted under tropical regions considering their specific environmental conditions. Multifactor studies under realistic field situations, such as free air CO2 enrichment with increasing CO2 and O3 concentrations incorporating spectral reflectance measures in situ for realistic assessment of plant growth, are a way forward. Effects of a changing climate on chemical and biological controls are discussed in the context of changing global outlook on environmental demands for the future.},

abstract = {Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration is increasingly affecting food production but how plant diseases will influence production and quality of food under rising CO2 is not well understood. With increased plant biomass at high CO2 the stubble-borne fungal pathogen Fusarium pseudograminearum causing crown rot (CR) of wheat may become more severe. We have studied inoculum production by Fusarium using fungal biomass per unit wheat stubble, stem browning from CR and the saprophytic fitness of Fusarium strains isolated from two wheat varieties grown in 2007 and 2008 at ambient and elevated CO2 in free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) with or without irrigation and once in a controlled environment. Fungal biomass, determined using primers for fungal ribosomal 18s and the TRI5 gene, increased significantly at elevated CO2 in two of the three studies. Stem browning increased significantly at elevated CO2 in the 2007 FACE study. At elevated CO2 increased stem browning was not influenced by irrigation in a susceptible variety but in a resistant variety stem browning increased by 68{\%} without irrigation. Wheat variety was significant in regression models explaining stem browning and Fusarium biomass but pathogen biomass at the two CO2 levels was not significantly linked to stem browning. Fusarium isolates from ambient and elevated CO2 did not differ significantly in their saprophytic fitness measured by the rate of colonization of wheat straw. We show that under elevated CO2Fusarium inoculum in stubbles will be amplified from increased crop and pathogen biomass while unimpeded saprophytic fitness will retain its effectiveness. If resistant varieties cannot completely stop infection, Fusarium will rapidly colonize stubble to further increase inoculum once the crop is harvested. Research should move beyond documenting the influence of elevated CO2 to developing disease management strategies from improved knowledge of pathogen biology and host resistance under rising CO2. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {This review describes environmental factors that influence severity of crop disease epidemics, especially in the UK and north-west Europe, in order to assess the effects of climate change on crop growth and yield and severity of disease epidemics. While work on some diseases, such as phoma stem canker of oilseed rape and fusarium ear blight of wheat, that combine crop growth, disease development and climate change models is described in detail, climate-change projections and predictions of the resulting biotic responses to them are complex to predict and detailed models linking climate, crop growth and disease development are not available for many crop-pathogen systems. This review uses a novel approach of comparing pathogen biology according to 'ecotype' (a categorization based on aspects such as epidemic type, dissemination method and infection biology), guided by detailed disease progress models where available to identify potential future research priorities for disease control. Consequences of projected climate change are assessed for factors driving elements of disease cycles of fungal pathogens (nine important pathogens are assessed in detail), viruses, bacteria and phytoplasmas. Other diseases classified according to 'ecotypes' were reviewed and likely changes in their severity used to guide comparable diseases about which less information is available. Both direct and indirect effects of climate change are discussed, with an emphasis on examples from the UK, and considered in the context of other factors that influence diseases and particularly emergence of new diseases, such as changes to farm practices and introductions of exotic material and effects of other environment changes such as elevated CO2. Good crop disease control will contribute to climate change mitigation by decreasing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture while sustaining production. Strategies for adaptation to climate change are needed to maintain disease control and crop yields in north-west Europe.},

abstract = {Deoxynivalenol (DON) content and Fusarium spp. (Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium avenaceum, Microdochium nivale and Fusarium poae) of mycotoxin-producing Fusarium species in winter wheat in Belgium (Flanders) were determined. Field trials were set up in the varietal testing network of Flanders Agricultural Centre for Small Grains (Roeselare 2013 Beitem, Belgium) and followed up during growing seasons 200120132002, 200220132003, 200320132004 and 200420132005. Fusarium infection and DON contamination were mainly influenced by location and environmental parameters. Mean DON levels ranged from 0 to 15 mg/kg. Over the period of four growing seasons cvs Deben, Ordeal and Napier had the highest DON contamination. Seasonal and local weather conditions before and during flowering together with local crop husbandry measures (crop rotation, soil preparation) seemed to be of great importance in explaining the variation in results obtained. At Bottelare a positive correlation between disease index and DON content was found for the growing seasons 200120132002 and 200220132003, but not the season 200320132004. Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum were in general the most frequently occurring Fusarium spp. in Flanders over the 4 years but the composition of the Fusarium population varied strongly from location to location and from year to year. Fusarium graminearum predominated in areas especially where maize was cultivated, whereas in areas with more small cereals in the crop rotation more F. culmorum was present. Also temperature played a role in the composition of Fusarium spp.},

We have developed a fluorescent-based polymerase chain reaction assay that allows for rapid and reliable identification of five toxigenic and pathogenic Fusarium species. The species includes Fusarium avenaceum, F. culmorum, F. equiseti, F. oxysporum and F. sambucinum. The method is based on the PCR amplification of species-specific DNA fragments using fluorescent oligonucleotide primers, which were designed based on sequence divergence within the internal transcribed spacer region of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Besides providing an accurate, reliable, and quick diagnosis of these Fusaria, another advantage with this method is that it reduces the potential for exposure to carcinogenic chemicals as it substitutes the use of fluorescent dyes in place of ethidium, bromide. Apart from its multidisciplinary importance and usefulness, it also obviates the need for gel electrophoresis.

An artificial growing substrate was infested with FOL to reach a final concentration of 1 x 10(4) CFU g(-1) of substrate. A non infested tank was used as control. Subsequently, 32 pots (21 each) were prepared from the infested tank and other 32 pots were prepared from the non infested tank (control). Lettuce plants were then transplanted into the pots and grown in phytotrons under four simulated environmental conditions: (1) 800 ppm CO2, 22-26 degrees C; (2) 800 ppm CO2, 18-22 degrees C; (3) 400 ppm CO2, 22-26 degrees C and (4) 400 ppm CO2, 18-22 degrees C. Substrate samples were collected from each phytotron at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after transplanting. Plate counts, enzymatic assays, and polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of climate change on the microbial population. The abundance of Fusarium spp. and the severity of Fusarium wilt of lettuce varied significantly as a consequence of increased temperature (22-26 degrees C). Increased CO2 levels showed no effect on the severity of Fusarium wilt of lettuce and on the abundance of Fusarium spp. On the other hand, the total bacterial abundance was reduced at elevated CO2 concentration (800 ppm). PCR-DGGE fingerprints of the ascomycete community obtained from DNA directly extracted from infested substrate samples did not change as a consequence of elevated temperature and CO2. Enzymatic activities were not affected by the elevated CO2 level. Our study indicates that the CO2 concentration used in our experiment had no detectable impact on Fusarium wilt of lettuce. Only temperature influenced all observed parameters, but did not affect the fungal species diversity. Other factors, such as nutrient limitation and the effect of plant species needs further study.

abstract = {A cursory glance at old textbooks of plant pathology reveals that the diseases which are the current scourge of agriculture in many parts of the world are a different set from those that were prominent 50 or 100 years ago. Why have these new diseases arisen? The traditional explanations subscribe to the "nature abhors a vacuum" principle-that control of one disease creates the condition for the emergence of a replacement-but does little to explain why the new pathogen succeeds. The emergence of a new disease requires a series of conditions and steps, including the enhanced fecundity of the new pathogen, enhanced survival from season to season, and spread around the world. Recently, evidence was obtained that wheat tan spot emerged through a lateral gene transfer event some time prior to 1941. Although there have been sporadic and persistent reports of lateral gene transfer between and into fungal plant pathogens, most examples have been dismissed through incomplete evidence. The completion of whole genome sequences of an increasing number of fungal pathogens no longer allows such proposed cases of lateral gene transfer to be dismissed so easily. How frequent are lateral gene transfers involving fungal plant pathogens, and can this process explain the emergence of many of the new diseases of the recent past? Many of the apparently new diseases are dependant on the expression of host-specific toxins. These are enigmatic molecules whose action requires the presence of plant genes with products that specifically encode sensitivity to the toxin and susceptibility to the disease. It is also notable that many new diseases belong to the fungal taxon dothideomycetes. This review explores the coincidence of new diseases, interspecific gene transfer, host-specific toxins, and the dothideomycete class.},

This technique is laborious and time-consuming, and a faster technique is desired. Seedlings of different cultivars of wheat were grown in steam-air treated soil inoculated with a band of wheat-barley grain colonized by F. graminearum. Plants were grown at 13, 19, and 25 C; and after 22 days the sheaths of leaves 1, 2, and 3 were rated for the extent of necrotic lesions. At each temperature, this rating was positively correlated with disease ratings of the same cultivars grown in the field. At 25 C, the correlation coefficient between seedling and mature plant ratings of 28 cultivars was 0.78 (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.01). This close relationship gives confidence that seedlings can be used to measure resistance to crown rot. Use of seedlings will speed the selection of resistant progeny in wheat breeding programs where resistance to crown rot is an objective.},

abstract = {Several previous studies have addressed pheromone communication in various flour beetles (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), including the confused flour beetle, Tribolium confusum (du Val). Different stereoisomers of 4,8-dimethyldecanal (DMD) were reported as the only components of an aggregation pheromone, but the behavioral activity of DMD is low. In the present study, additional previously reported secondary metabolites (benzoquinones and hydrocarbons) were tested for electrophysiological activity (EAG) with both sexes of T. confusum. Two benzoquinones and three monoenic hydrocarbons elicited significant EAG activity from both male and female antennae. There was an elevated male EAG response (vs. the females) to two out of the three hydrocarbons and for both quinones. The EAG-active compounds were subsequently investigated for behavioral activity in a walking bioassay. Benzoquinones are considered toxic and have been assigned a function as alarm substances in flour beetles, but we found that methyl-1, 4-benzoquinone in intermediate concentrations was attractive to both male and female beetles and could therefore act as an aggregation pheromone component. Males were also attracted to ethyl-1,4-benzoquinone. The corresponding hydroquinones, presumed precursors of the benzoquinones, did not elicit any electrophysiological response and were not tested for behavioral activity. The unsaturated hydrocarbons (1-tetradecene, 1-pentadecene, and 1-hexadecene) elicited significant EAG responses from both male and female antennae and were also attractive in the behavioral assay. Our results show that several beetle-produced compounds, in addition to 4,8-dimethyldecanal, may be part of a complex pheromone system in flour beetles and play a role in mediating aggregation in T. confusum.},

Under constant light, ascospore discharge occurred at maximal rates at relative humidity levels greater than 92{\%}. When perithecia were placed under conditions of high external osmolarity, ascospore discharge was significantly reduced. Ascospores were discharged from asci along with droplets of fluid, the epiplasm, from within the ascus. Analysis of discharged epiplasmic fluid by GC-MASS Spectrometry revealed that mannitol was the major simple sugar component of the fluid. Activity of mannitol dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the conversion of fructose to mannitol, was higher in protein extracts from mature perithecia than in extracts from vegetative tissue. Several inhibitors of K+ and Ca++ ion channels inhibited ascospore discharge, which suggested that ascospore discharge resulted from the buildup of turgor pressure generated by ion fluxes and mannitol accumulation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing technology is an important tool for the rapid, genome-wide identification of genetic variations. However, it is difficult to resolve the 'signal' of variations of interest and the 'noise' of stochastic sequencing and bioinformatic errors in the large datasets that are generated. We report a simple approach to identify regional linkage to a trait that requires only two pools of DNA to be sequenced from progeny of a defined genetic cross (i.e. bulk segregant analysis) at low coverage ({\textless}10×) and without parentage assignment of individual SNPs. The analysis relies on regional averaging of pooled SNP frequencies to rapidly scan polymorphisms across the genome for differential regional homozygosity, which is then displayed graphically. RESULTS: Progeny from defined genetic crosses of Tribolium castaneum (F₄ and F₁₉) segregating for the phosphine resistance trait were exposed to phosphine to select for the resistance trait while the remainders were left unexposed. Next generation sequencing was then carried out on the genomic DNA from each pool of selected and unselected insects from each generation. The reads were mapped against the annotated T. castaneum genome from NCBI (v3.0) and analysed for SNP variations. Since it is difficult to accurately call individual SNP frequencies when the depth of sequence coverage is low, variant frequencies were averaged across larger regions. Results from regional SNP frequency averaging identified two loci, tc{\_}rph1 on chromosome 8 and tc{\_}rph2 on chromosome 9, which together are responsible for high level resistance. Identification of the two loci was possible with only 5-7× average coverage of the genome per dataset. These loci were subsequently confirmed by direct SNP marker analysis and fine-scale mapping. Individually, homozygosity of tc{\_}rph1 or tc{\_}rph2 results in only weak resistance to phosphine (estimated at up to 1.5-2.5× and 3-5× respectively), whereas in combination they interact synergistically to provide a high-level resistance {\textgreater}200×. The tc{\_}rph2 resistance allele resulted in a significant fitness cost relative to the wild type allele in unselected beetles over eighteen generations. CONCLUSION: We have validated the technique of linkage mapping by low-coverage sequencing of progeny from a simple genetic cross. The approach relied on regional averaging of SNP frequencies and was used to successfully identify candidate gene loci for phosphine resistance in T. castaneum. This is a relatively simple and rapid approach to identifying genomic regions associated with traits in defined genetic crosses that does not require any specialised statistical analysis.},

abstract = {Wheat seed samples with different initial infection levels of Fusarium culmorum were kept under different storage conditions for 36 weeks. Samples for analysis were drawn before storage and at intervals of 6-8 weeks to determine the mycotoxin contents, seed health and seed quality. Zearalcnone (ZEA) accumulated to higher kernel contents towards the end of storage, when the seed was stored under warm and humid conditions [25°C/90{\%} relative humidity (RH)], whereas the deoxynivalenol (DON) content of severely infected kernel samples ({\textgreater} 50{\%}) remained unchanged under any of the conditions. On the other hand, DON contents increased in samples with a slight (4{\%}) or moderate (15{\%}) Fusarium infection level. when the seed was stored under Warm and humid conditions. Nivalenol (NIV) was not found in any samples immediately after harvest but later on in storage, and only under cool or warm but very humid conditions (15°C/84{\%} RH and 25°C/90{\%} RH). During storage, the mycotoxin contents of the samples did not reflect the percentage of Fusarium infected kernels. Under warm but dry conditions (25°C/62{\%} RH) the seed germination rate showed a slight increase or remained nearly constant; at the same time the Fusarium infection level of the kernels decreased fairly fast. Cool and dry conditions (15°C/56{\%} RH) maintained good seed quality but the Fusarium infection level of the kernels remained largely the same. Warm and humid conditions are not appropriate to maintaining quality of both seed and grain product.

abstract = {Inheritance of resistance to phosphine fumigant was investigated in three field-collected strains of rusty grain beetle, Cryptolestes ferrugineus, Susceptible (S-strain), Weakly Resistant (Weak-R) and Strongly Resistant (Strong-R). The strains were purified for susceptibility, weak resistance and strong resistance to phosphine, respectively, to ensure homozygosity of resistance genotype. Crosses were established between S-strain ?? Weak-R, S-strain ?? Strong-R and Weak-R ?? Strong-R, and the dose mortality responses to phosphine of these strains and their F1, F2 and F1-backcross progeny were obtained. The fumigations were undertaken at 25 ??C and 55{\%} RH for 72 h.Weak-R and Strong-R showed resistance factors of 6.3?? and 505?? compared with S-strain at the LC50. Both weak and strong resistances were expressed as incompletely recessive with degrees of dominance of -0.48 and -0.43 at the LC50, respectively. Responses of F2 and F1-backcross progeny indicated the existence of one major gene in Weak-R, and at least two major genes in Strong-R, one of which was allelic with the major factor in Weak-R. Phenotypic variance analyses also estimated that the number of independently segregating genes conferring weak resistance was 1 (nE = 0.89) whereas there were two genes controlling strong resistance (nE = 1.2). The second gene, unique to Strong-R, interacted synergistically with the first gene to confer a very high level of resistance ({\~{}}80??). Neither of the two major resistance genes was sex linked. Despite the similarity of the genetics of resistance to that previously observed in other pest species, a significant proportion ({\~{}}15 to 30{\%}) of F1 individuals survived at phosphine concentrations higher than predicted. Thus it is likely that additional dominant heritable factors, present in some individuals in the population, also influenced the resistance phenotype.Our results will help in understanding the process of selection for phosphine resistance in the field which will inform resistance management strategies. In addition, this information will provide a basis for the identification of the resistance genes.},

The disease was more severe under high CO2 concentration. Area under disease progress curve was 35.43 under high CO2 concentration and 17.48 for the current concentration.

abstract = {The mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON), produced by several Fusarium spp., acts as a virulence factor and is essential for symptom development after initial wheat infection. Accumulating evidence shows that the production of this secondary metabolite can be triggered by diverse environmental and cellular signals, implying that it might have additional roles during the life cycle of the fungus. Here, we review data that position DON in the saprophytic fitness of Fusarium, in defense and in the primary C and N metabolism of the plant and the fungus. We combine the available information in speculative models on the role of DON throughout the interaction with the host, providing working hypotheses that await experimental validation. We also highlight the possible impact of control measures in the field on DON production and summarize the influence of abiotic factors during processing and storage of food and feed matrices. Altogether, we can conclude that DON is a very important compound for Fusarium to cope with a changing environment and to assure its growth, survival, and production of toxic metabolites in diverse situations.},

abstract = {Climate change (CC) scenarios are predicted to have significant effects on the security of staple commodities. A key component of this impact is the infection of such crops by mycotoxigenic moulds and contamination with mycotoxins. The impacts of CC on mycotoxigenic fungi requires examination of the impacts of the three-way interactions between elevated CO2(350–400 vs 650–1200 ppm), temperature increases (+2–5 °C) and drought stress on growth/mycotoxin production by key spoilage fungi in cereals and nuts. This review examines the available evidence on the impacts of interacting CC factors on growth and mycotoxin production by key mycotoxigenic fungi including Alternaria, Aspergillus, Fusarium and Penicillium species. Aspergillus flavus responsible for producing aflatoxin B1(AFB1) is a class 1A carcinogen and its growth appears to be unaffected by CC factors. However, there is a significant stimulation of AFB1production both in vitro and in vivo in maize. In contrast, studies on Aspergillus section Circumdati and Nigri species responsible for ochratoxin A contamination of a range of commodities and F. verticillioides and fumonisins suggest that some species are more resilient than others, especially in terms of mycotoxin production. Acclimatisation of mycotoxigenic fungal pathogens to CC factors may result in increased disease and perhaps mycotoxin contamination of staple cereals. Predictive modelling approaches to help identify regions where maximum impact may occur in terms of infection by mycotoxigenic fungi and toxin contamination of staple crops is hindered by the lack of reliable inputs on effects of the interacting CC factors. The present available knowledge is discussed in the context of the resilience of staple food chains and the impact that interacting CC factors may have on the availability of food in the future.},

To illustrate such effects, a weather-based disease forecasting model was combined with a climate change model predicting UK temperature and rainfall under high-and low-carbon emissions for the 2020s and 2050s. Multi-site data collected over a 15-year period were used to develop and validate a weather-based model forecasting severity of phoma stem canker epidemics on oilseed rape across the UK. This was combined with climate change scenarios to predict that epidemics will not only increase in severity but also spread northwards by the 2020s. These results provide a stimulus to develop models to predict the effects of climate change on other plant diseases, especially in delicately balanced agricultural or natural ecosystems. Such predictions can be used to guide policy and practice in adapting to effects of climate change on food security and wildlife.},

abstract = {Current models predict that expected climate change in Ontario will significantly affect the occurrence of plant diseases in agriculture and forestry in the coming years. Direct, multiple effects on the epidemiology of plant diseases are expected, including the survival of primary inoculum, the rate of disease progress during a growing season, and the duration of epidemics. These effects will positively or negatively influence individual pathogens and the diseases they cause. Changes in the spectra of diseases are also anticipated. Abiotic diseases associated with environmental extremes are expected to increase, and interactions between biotic and abiotic diseases might represent the most important effects of climate change on plant diseases. The management of plant diseases will also be affected. In agriculture, plant breeding programs are expected to adapt many crops to increased duration of growing seasons and, concurrently, to develop drought and stress tolerance. There will be opportunities for new crops and cultivars to be introduced, but effective systems must be in place to detect new pathogens and prevent them from entering with these new crops. Because of the long-lived nature of trees, forests are slow to adapt, and the impact of climate change will have to be considered in forest management plans. Adaptations in agriculture and forestry have been occurring in Ontario for over 100 years, but these may need to occur at an accelerated rate because of rapid changes in climate. It is critical that the infrastructure of agricultural and forestry research remains strong to ensure successful transition and adaptation.},

abstract = {Crops of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Hereward) were grown within temperature gradient tunnels at a range of temperatures at either c. 350 or 700 mu mol mol(-1) CO2 in 1991/92 and 1992/93 at Reading, UK. At terminal spikelet stage, leaf area was 45{\%} greater at elevated CO2 in the first year due to more tillers, and was 30{\%} greater in the second year due to larger leaf areas on the primary tillers. At harvest maturity, total crop biomass was negatively related to mean seasonal temperature within each year and CO2 treatment, due principally to shorter crop durations at the warmer temperatures. Biomass was 6-31{\%} greater at elevated compared with normal CO2 and was also affected by a positive interaction between temperature and CO2 in the first year only. Seed yield per unit area was greater at cooler temperatures and at elevated CO2 concentrations. A 7-44{\%} greater seed dry weight at elevated CO2 in the first year was due to more ears per unit area and heavier grains. In the following year, mean seed dry weight was increased by {\textgreater} 72{\%} at elevated CO2, because grain numbers per ear did not decline with an increase in temperature at elevated CO2. Grain numbers were reduced by temperatures {\textgreater} 31 degrees C immediately before anthesis at normal atmospheric CO2 in 1992/93, and at both CO2 concentrations in 1991/92. To quantify the impact of future climates of elevated CO2 concentrations and warmer temperatures on wheat yields, consideration of both interactions between CO2 and mean seasonal temperature, and possible effects of instantaneous temperatures on yield components at different CO2 concentrations are required. Nevertheless, the results obtained suggest that the benefits to winter wheat grain yield from CO2 doubling are offset by an increase in mean seasonal temperature of only 1.0 degrees C to 1.8 degrees C in the UK.},

abstract = {With current annual production at over 600 million tonnes, wheat is the third largest crop in the world behind corn and rice, and an essential source of carbohydrates for millions of people. While wheat is grown over a wide range of environments, it is common in the major wheat-producing countries for grain filling to occur when soil moisture is declining and temperature is increasing. Average global temperatures have increased over the last decades and are predicted to continue rising, along with a greater frequency of extremely hot days. Such events have already been reported for major wheat growing regions in the world. However, the direct impact of past temperature variability and changes in averages and extremes on wheat production has not been quantified. Attributing changes in observed yields over recent decades to a single factor such as temperature is not possible due to the confounding effects of other factors. By using simulation modelling, we were able to separate the impact of temperature from other factors and show that the effect of temperature on wheat production has been underestimated. Surprisingly, observed variations in average growing-season temperatures of +/- 2 degrees C in the main wheat growing regions of Australia can cause reductions in grain production of up to 50{\%}. Most of this can be attributed to increased leaf senescence as a result of temperatures {\textgreater} 34 degrees C. Temperature conditions during grain filling in the major wheat growing regions of the world are similar to the Australian conditions during grain filling. With average temperatures and the frequency of heat events projected to increase world-wide with global warming, yield reductions due to higher temperatures during the important grain-filling stage alone could substantially undermine future global food security. Adaptation strategies need to be considered now to prevent substantial yield losses in wheat from increasing future heat stress.},

abstract = {A trichodiene synthase gene (Tri5) was amplified from F. poae by polymerase chain reaction using synthetic primers constructed on the basis of the coding portion of the same gene from F. sporotrichioides. Sequence analysis showed a high degree of similarity with other trichodiene synthase genes. A 378 bp HindlII fragment of the gene that contains the genetic information for the putative active site of the trichodiene synthase enzyme was radiolabelled and used for dot blot analysis. This probe could detect Tri5 hybridization in 1-10 ng DNA of fusaria that have the genetic potentiality to synthesize toxic trichothecene compounds, but gave no reaction with trichothecene nonproducing members of the genus. When other fungi reported to produce trichothecenes (Myrothecium, Stachybotrys, Trichoderma, Trichothecium spp.) were tested, only strains of Myrothecium and Stachybotrys gave strong positive reaction. Faint but consistent hybridization signals were obtained in four species (F. semitectum, F. tricinctum, Trichoderma viride and Trichothecium roseum) indicating the presence of nonhomologous evolutionary variants or inactive remnants of the Tri5 gene in these fungi.},

abstract = {The 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change commits signatories to preventing ‘dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system', leaving unspecified the level of global warming that is dangerous. In the late 1990s, a limit of 2°C global warming above preindustrial temperature was proposed as a ‘guard rail' below which most of the dangerous climate impacts could be avoided. The 2009 Copenhagen Accord recognized the scientific view ‘that the increase in global temperature should be below 2 degrees Celsius' despite growing views that this might be too high. At the same time, the continued rise in greenhouse gas emissions in the past decade and the delays in a comprehensive global emissions reduction agreement have made achieving this target extremely difficult, arguably impossible, raising the likelihood of global temperature rises of 3°C or 4°C within this century. Yet, there are few studies that assess the potential impacts and consequences of a warming of 4°C or greater in a systematic manner. Papers in this themed issue provide an initial picture of the challenges facing a world that warms by 4°C or more, and the difficulties ahead if warming is to be limited to 2°C with any reasonable certainty. Across many sectors—coastal cities, agriculture, water stress, ecosystems, migration—the impacts and adaptation challenges at 4°C will be larger than at 2°C. In some cases, such as farming in sub-Saharan Africa, a +4°C warming could result in the collapse of systems or require transformational adaptation out of systems, as we understand them today. The potential severity of impacts and the behavioural, institutional, societal and economic challenges involved in coping with these impacts argue for renewed efforts to reduce emissions, using all available mechanisms, to minimize the chances of high-end climate change. Yet at the same time, there is a need for accelerated and focused research that improves understanding of how the climate system might behave under a +4°C warming, what the impacts of such changes might be and how best to adapt to what would be unprecedented changes in the world we live in.},

Klaxon) plants were exposed to mixtures of SO2 + NO2 (at concentrations of 24-35 nl l-1 of each gas, depending upon fumigation system), or to charcoal-filtered, or unfiltered ambient air during the period in which the second, and subsequent, leaves were emerging. The ability of individual detached leaves to regulate water loss was then examined after terminating the pollutant treatment. Observations of diurnal changes in stomatal resistance of well-watered plants, using a viscous flow porometer, failed to indicate any major alterations which could be attributed to prior exposure to SO2 + NO2. By contrast, when an ABA solution (10(-1) mol m-3) was applied to detached leaves, the stomata of polluted plants were less responsive than plants previously exposed to control air. The dynamics of the observed responses strongly implicated impaired physiology of the guard cells rather than mechanical changes in the epidermis that might, for example, result from damage to the cuticle. Stomatal closure was considerably slower in polluted leaves compared with the controls. This decline in responsiveness to ABA was observed using leaves excised from well-watered plants and in the absence of any externally visible injury. The ability of stomata to respond to a range of CO2 concentrations from 195-735-mu-mol mol-1 was also examined using individual leaves, attached to the plant, in an environmentally controlled cuvette. Here the stomata of leaves which had been fumigated with SO2 + NO2 behaved in a similar manner to the non-fumigated leaves, both showing closure in elevated CO2 concentrations.},

abstract = {causes crown rot in wheat and barley. Displacement of Fp from stubble by other fungi was explored. Fungi were isolated from field collections of stubble and identified using morphological and molecular methods. The most abundant species were Alternaria sp., Sterile sp. 1 and Fp. Representative isolates of all species were screened in dual culture with Fp to select candidates for detailed experiments on displacement. Trichoderma harzianum (Th), Alternaria infectoria (Ai), Fusarium equiseti (Fe) and Fusarium nygamai (Fn) were chosen as representing the range of interaction types found. The effects of temperature (5-35C) and water potential (-0.3 to -5 MPa) on growth rates, displacement of Fp from infested barley straw and dual culture interaction with Fp were determined. Th was the strongest antagonist overall, but displaced Fp very poorly at the lowest temperatures and water potentials. It was more antagonistic than expected from effects on growth at high temperature and less antagonistic than expected at low temperature. Fe and Fn showed consistent mutual antagonism with Fp on contact in dual culture and gave moderate displacement of Fp from straw, with Fe being the most effective antagonist under cool dry conditions. Ai gave very poor displacement of Fp from straw, despite being the most common straw fungus, confirming that displacement was due to antagonism and not just the presence of other fungi. The type of interaction in dual culture was consistent with degree of displacement from straw and could be used to indicate which environmental conditions were most limiting for an antagonist. The ability to displace Fp under cool dry conditions appears to be critical.},

@article{Chakraborty2012a,
abstract = {Soil multitrophic interactions transfer energy from plants as the predominant primary producer to communities of organisms that occupy different positions in the food chain and are linked by multiple ecological networks, which is the soil food web. Soil food web sequesters carbon, cycles nutrients, maintains soil health to suppress pathogens, helps plants tolerate abiotic and biotic stress, and maintains ecosystem resilience and sustainability. Understanding the influence of climate change on soil multitrophic interactions is necessary to maintain these essential ecosystem services. But summarising this influence is a daunting task due to a paucity of knowledge and a lack of clarity on the ecological networks that constitute these interactions. The scant literature is fragmented along disciplinary lines, often reporting inconsistent findings that are context and scale-dependent. We argue for the differentiation of soil multitrophic interactions along functional and spatial domains to capture cross-disciplinary knowledge and mechanistically link all ecological networks to reproduce full functionalities of the soil food web. Distinct from litter mediated interactions in detritosphere or elsewhere in the soil, the proposed pathogen suppression and stress tolerance interactions operate in the rhizosphere. A review of the literature suggests that climate change will influence the relative importance, frequency and composition of functional groups, their trophic interactions and processes controlling these interactions. Specific climate change factors generally have a beneficial influence on pathogen suppression and stress tolerance, but findings on the overall soil food web are inconsistent due to a high level of uncertainty. In addition to an overall improvement in the understanding of soil multitrophic interactions using empirical and modelling approaches, we recommend linking biodiversity to function, understanding influence of combinations of climatic factors on multitrophic interactions and the evolutionary ecology of multitrophic interactions in a changing climate as areas that deserve most attention.},

Three additional nitrogen fertilizer treatments were carried out at the lowest and the highest CO2 level, respectively. Plants were harvested at growth stages 31, 65 and 93 and separated into up to eight fractions to gain information about biomass partitioning. CO2 enrichment (263 mu l litre(-1) above ambient levels) drastically increased biomass of organs serving as long-term carbohydrate pools. Peduncle weight increased by 92{\%}, stem weight by 73{\%} and flag leaf sheath weight by 59{\%} at growth stage 65. Average increase in shoot biomass due to CO2 enrichment amounted to 51{\%} at growth stage 65 and 36{\%} at final harvest. Average yield increase was 34{\%}. Elevated nitrogen application was most effective on biomass of green tissues. Yield was increased by 30{\%} when nitrogen application was increased from 150 to 270 kg N ha(-1). Significant interactions were observed between CO2 enrichment and nitrogen application. Yield increase due to CO2 ranged from 23{\%} at 120 kg N to 47{\%} at 330 kg N. Triticum aestivum cv.

We evaluated the effects of elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) and ozone (O-3) on three economically important soybean diseases (downy mildew, Septoria brown spot and sudden death syndrome-SDS) under natural field conditions at the soybean free air concentration enrichment (SoyFACE) facility. Disease incidence and/or severity were quantified from 2005 to 2007 using visual surveys and digital image analysis, and changes were related to microclimatic variability and to structural and chemical changes in soybean host plants. Changes in atmospheric composition altered disease expression, but responses of the three pathosystems varied considerably. Elevated CO2 alone or in combination with O-3 significantly reduced downy mildew disease severity (measured as area under the disease progress curve-AUDPC) by 39-66{\%} across the 3 years of the study. In contrast, elevated CO2 alone or in combination with O-3 significantly increased brown spot severity in all 3 years, but the increase was small in magnitude. When brown spot severity was assessed in relation to differences in canopy height induced by the atmospheric treatments, disease severity increased under combined elevated CO2 and O-3 treatment in only one of the 3 years. The atmospheric treatments had no effect on the incidence of SDS or brown spot throughout the study. Higher precipitation during the 2006 growing season was associated with increased AUDPC severity across all treatments by 2.7 and 1.4 times for downy mildew and brown spot, respectively, compared with drought conditions in 2005. In the 2 years with similar precipitation, the higher daily temperatures in the late spring of 2007 were associated with increased severity of downy mildew and brown spot. Elevated CO2 and O-3 induced changes in the soybean canopy density and leaf age likely contributed to the disease expression modifications.},

One of the factors hindering the progress of breeding for crown rot resistance is the lack of a reliable and high throughput bioassay that allows rapid and accurate assessment of large numbers of genotypes so that highly susceptible materials can be quickly rejected and potentially resistant lines identified for more focused further assessments. We developed a method which, by growing several inoculated seedlings wrapped in a single piece of moist paper towel, offers significant advantages over all of the existing methods. The new soil-less assay takes only about two weeks, requires very little space, and removes variability associated with the use of soil/potting mixes. Results from the new assay are highly reproducible and agree well with known field performances of different varieties. However, mapping studies conducted using the new soil-less assay did not detect all of the quantitative trait loci found with a soil-based assay. These results show that, although different resistance genes may all contribute to the performance of a variety, caution should be used when comparing results from different assays.},

abstract = {The genus Plutella was thought to be represented in Australia by a single introduced species, Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus), the diamondback moth. Its status as a major pest of cruciferous crops, and the difficulty in developing control strategies has motivated broad-ranging studies on its biology. Prior genetic work has generally supported the conclusion that populations of this migratory species are connected by substantial gene flow. However, the present study reveals the presence of two genetically divergent lineages of this taxonin Australia. One shows close genetic and morphological similarity with the nearly cosmopolitan Plutella xylostella. The second lineage possesses a similar external morphology, but marked sequence divergence in the barcode region of the cytochrome c oxidase I gene, coupled with clear differences in genitalia. As a consequence, members of this lineage are described as a new species, Plutella australiana Landry {\&} Hebert, which is broadly distributed in the eastern half of Australia.},

This work aimed to identify genetic resistances sources, to evaluated the detection of resistance with an alternative method and to verify the effects of structural mechanisms in pathogen resistance. The genotypes evaluated were Heliconia bihai, H. psittacorum cv. Golden Torch, H. psittacorum cv. Golden Torch Adrian, H. rostrata, H. stricta Capri, H. psittacorum cv. Sassy, H. caribea, H. latispatha, H. wagneriana, H. psittacorum cv. Alan Carle, H. stricta cv. Fire Bird and H. chartacea cv. Sexy Pink. These genotypes were inoculated with a F. oxysporum f.sp. cubense isolate and the symptoms were evaluated 40 days after inoculation, based on an disease rating scale ranging from 1 to 6. The genotypes considered resistant were H. bihai, H. psittacorum cvs. Golden Torch and Golden Torch Adrian, H. rostrata, H. stricta cv. Capri, H. psittacorum cv. Sassy and H. caribea. The alternative method for resistance detection consisted in the utilization of fungal filtrades obtained after cultivation in Czapek medium. Several concentrations of filtrates were evaluated on detached of H. psittacorum cvs. Golden Torch (resistant) and Alan Carle (susceptible) cultivars. The evaluation was carried out at 48 hours of incubation, and the filtrate with concentration of 50{\%} was the more efficient for distinction of resistance. Structural resistance mechanism was analyzed in histological sections in roots of the species inoculated and non inoculated utilized in resistance study. It was possible to verify the absence of relation of resistance in the lignification of root cells.},

abstract = {Published data from long-term trials at Moree, New South Wales (1986-1996), and Billa Billa, Queensland (1986-1993), were analysed to determine the factors that influence the incidence of crown rot, caused by Fusarium pseudograminearum, in successive stubble-retained, no-till wheat crops and to examine the feasibility of developing a forecasting system for the disease. Polyetic progress of the epidemics could be described by a form of the logistic growth model with a carrying capacity (K) about 5{\%} higher than the maximum recorded incidence at each site. Infection rate between seasons was positively correlated with yield and in-crop rainfall in the previous season, both of which were indicators of biomass. Infection rate was negatively correlated with rainfall parameters during the summer fallows, which were indicators of conditions favouring residue decomposition. In-crop rainfall, stored soil moisture and temperature parameters were not significantly correlated with infection rates. Multiple regressions based on incidence in the previous season, summer rainfall and either yield or in-crop rainfall in the previous season accounted for 65-81{\%} of the variation in disease incidence at Moree and 86{\%} of the variation in incidence at Billa Billa. Simplified parameters for use in on-farm forecasting systems were explored. The most useful of these was the square root of the product of incidence and either yield or in-crop rainfall, which gave sufficiently accurate predictions at each site to estimate the qualitative risk of crown rot in the following crop. This could be used to decide whether management options such as resistant varieties, rotations or burning were required.},

abstract = {Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr) induces tan necrosis and chlorosis in wheat. These symptoms are interaction phenotypes between individual isolates and specific wheat genotypes. The induction of tan necrosis is associated with the production of the Ptr-necrosis toxin by nec+ isolates of Ptr and the presence of a dominant gene for toxin sensitivity in the host. The effect of temperature on the development of tan necrosis and chlorosis was investigated using eight wheat genotypes differing in reaction to tan spot and three isolates from the three currently available virulent pathotypes of Ptr. The following constant temperature regimes were tested: 10, 15, 20, 22, 25, 27, and 30 degrees C. At 27 and 30 degrees C, a clear change towards resistance, both necrotic and chlorotic, was observed in the susceptible genotypes. Reaction types of the same lines/cultivars were not altered at temperatures of 25 degrees C or below. Throughout this study, no breakdown of resistance was observed. Temperature-induced resistance to the fungus was paralleled by temperature-induced insensitivity to the Ptr-necrosis toxin. No symptoms were observed in toxin-infiltrated sensitive Glenlea wheat plants kept at 30 degrees C. The data of this study suggest that, in the necrotic system, the induced resistance observed at temperatures above 27 degrees C may have resulted from the failure of the toxin to interact with its putative receptor.},

abstract = {Crown rot of wheat (Triticum aestivum), predominantly caused by the fungus Fusarium pseudograminearum, has become an increasingly important disease constraint in many winter cereal production regions in Australia. Our group has previously identified a range of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for partial resistance to crown rot in various bread wheat sources. Here, we report on work that has assessed the effectiveness of pyramiding QTL to improve resistance to crown rot. Two doubled haploid populations were analysed-one from a cross between two previously characterised sources of partial seedling resistance (2-49 and W21MMT70; n = 208) and one from a cross between 2-49 and the commercial variety Sunco, a source of adult field resistance (n = 134). Both populations were phenotyped for seedling resistance to crown rot. Microsatellite and DArT markers were used to construct whole genome linkage maps for use in composite interval mapping (CIM) to identify QTL. Three QTL were detected in both trials conducted on the 2-49/W21MMT70 population. These were located on chromosomes 1D (QCr.usq-1D.1), 3B (QCr.usq-3B.1) and 7A. QCr.usq-1D.1 and the previously undetected 7A QTL were inherited from 2-49. QCr.usq-3B.1, inherited from W21MMT70, was the most significant of the QTL, explaining up to 40.5{\%} of the phenotypic variance. Three QTL were identified in multiple trials of the Sunco/2-49 population. These were located on chromosomes 1D (QCr.usq-1D.1), 2B (QCr.usq-2B.2) and 4B (QCr.usq-4B.1). Only QCr.usq-2B.2 was inherited from Sunco. QCr.usq-4B.1 was the most significant of these QTL, explaining up to 19.1{\%} of the phenotypic variance. In the 2-49/W21MMT70 population, several DH lines performed significantly better than either parent, with the best recording an average disease severity rating of only 3.8{\%} of that scored by the susceptible check cultivar Puseas. These lines represent a new level of seedling crown rot resistance in wheat.},

abstract = {Despite complex regional patterns of projected climate change, significant decreases in food crop yields have been predicted using the ‘worst case' CO2 emission scenario (A1FI) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Overall, climate change is predicted to have a progressively negative effect on the yield of food crops, particularly in the absence of efforts to mitigate global CO2 emissions. As with all species, plant pathogens will have varying responses to climate change. Whilst the life cycle of some pathogens will be limited by increasing temperatures, e.g. Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici, other climatic factors such as increasing atmospheric CO2, may provide more favourable conditions for pathogens such as Fusarium pseudograminearum. Based on published literature and unpublished work in progress, we have reviewed the qualitative effects of climate change on pathogens that cause disease of four major food crops: wheat, rice, soybean and potato. The limited data show that the influence will be positive, negative or neutral, depending on the host–pathogen interaction. Quantitative analysis of climate change on pathogens of these crops is largely lacking, either from field or laboratory studies or from modelling-based assessments. Systematic quantitative analysis of these effects will be necessary in developing future disease management plans, such as plant breeding, altered planting schedules, chemical and biological control methods and increased monitoring for new disease threats.},

abstract = {The ascomycete Fusarium graminearum is a destructive fungal pathogen of wheat (Triticum aestivum). To better understand how this pathogen proliferates within the host plant, we tracked pathogen growth inside wheat coleoptiles and then examined pathogen gene expression inside wheat coleoptiles at 16, 40, and 64 h after inoculation (HAI) using laser capture microdissection and microarray analysis. We identified 344 genes that were preferentially expressed during invasive growth in planta. Gene expression profiles for 134 putative plant cell wall-degrading enzyme genes suggest that there was limited cell wall degradation at 16 HAI and extensive degradation at 64 HAI. Expression profiles for genes encoding reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related enzymes suggest that F. graminearum primarily scavenges extracellular ROS before a later burst of extracellular ROS is produced by F. graminearum enzymes. Expression patterns of genes involved in primary metabolic pathways suggest that F. graminearum relies on the glyoxylate cycle at an early stage of plant infection. A secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene cluster was specifically induced at 64 HAI and was required for virulence. Our results indicate that F. graminearum initiates infection of coleoptiles using covert penetration strategies and switches to overt cellular destruction of tissues at an advanced stage of infection.},

abstract = {The Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC) has been studied intensively but its association with legumes, particularly under European agro-climatic conditions, is still poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated phylogenetic relationships and aggressiveness of 79 isolates of the FSSC collected from pea, subterranean clover, white clover and winter vetch grown under diverse agro-climatic and soil conditions within Temperate and Mediterranean Europe. The isolates were characterized by sequencing tef1 and rpb2 loci and by greenhouse aggressiveness assays. The majority of the isolates belonged to two lineages: the F. pisi comb. nov. lineage (formerly F. solani f. sp. pisi) mainly accommodating German and Swiss isolates, and the Fusisporium (Fusarium) solani lineage accommodating mainly Italian isolates. Based on the results of aggressiveness tests on pea, most of the isolates were classified as weakly to moderately aggressive. In addition, using one model strain, 62 accessions of 10 legume genera were evaluated for their potential to host F. pisi, the species known mainly as a pathogen of pea. A total of 58 accessions were colonized, with 25 of these being asymptomatic hosts. These results suggest a broad host range for F. pisi and challenge the forma specialis naming system in Fusarium.},

The objective of this research was to clarify the origin of virulence within F. oxysporum, the relationship between pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains, and the evolution of the different races of F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis. Bootstrapped parsimony analysis of the partial IGS sequence data identified a phylogenetic tree with highly significant branches. The two F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis VCGs, 0131 and 0134, were separated into distinct lineages. Race was not distinguished by significant IGS sequence differences within the pathogen VCGs. One exception was a race 1 isolate which was associated with VCG 0131 but, based on both mtDNA and IGS haplotype, had greater affinity with VCG 0134. Two IGS sequence types were found in this race 1 isolate, one suggesting an affiliation with VCG 0131 and the other similar to isolates in VCG 0134. This may have resulted from past somatic or sexual interactions between F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis, VCGs 0131 and 0134. Nonpathogens that were vegetatively compatible with the pathogen were not closely related to the pathogen based on IGS sequence data. Thus, nonpathogens and pathogens may share common alleles at vegetative compatibility loci by coincidence rather than because of recent clonal derivation from a common ancestor.},

abstract = {Spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L cv. Triso) was grown in a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) field experiment in order to gain information on CO2-induced effects on grain composition and quality at maturity. A proteome analysis was performed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and protein identification was done with mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In elevated CO2 (526 mu l l(-1)), an increase of 13.5{\%} in grain yield was observed relative to 375 mu l l(-1) at a low level of significance (P = 0.528). Total grain protein concentration was decreased by 3.5{\%} at a high level of statistical significance. Most importantly, a number of statistically significant changes within the grain proteome were observed, as the levels of 32 proteins were affected by elevated CO2: 16 proteins were up-regulated and 16 were down-regulated. Our experiment demonstrates that high-CO2 can markedly affect the proteome of mature wheat grain. The potential role of the proteins, changed in response to CO2 enrichment, is discussed as some may affect grain quality. For the task of selecting cultivars resistant to CO2-induced quality loss, we propose to consider the proteins affected by elevated CO2 identified in this work here. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Climate change will change patterns of disease through changes in host distribution and phenology, changes in plant-associated microflora and direct biological effects on rapidly evolving pathogens. Short-term forecast models coupled with weather generated from climate simulations may be a basis for projection; however, they will often fail to capture long-term trends effectively. Verification of predictions is a major difficulty; the most convincing method would be to "back-forecast" observed historical changes. Unfortunately, we lack of empirical data over long time-spans; most of what is known concerns invasions, in which climate is not the main driving factor. In one case where long-term prevalence can be deduced, climate had little to do with change. Resilience to surprises should be the most important policy aim.},
annote = {At least in the short term, the problem is also made more difficult becasue the life-cycles of fungi and bacteris are intimately related to precipitation. Precipitation patterns are both harder to model, and harder to verify, so that the most critical aspect of climate prediction is also one of the least reliable (Solomon et al. 2007, Chapter 8)
The community of species within an ecosystem is determined by soil, climate, management and the accidents of history and evolution. Within this context, plant pathogens are one of the more visible microbial components and crops on of the more intensively managed components.

Typical asexual generational timescales will be days to weeks; sexual time scales of the order of years. Evolutionary changes depend on the strength of the selecting force

Evolutionart changes depend on the strenght og the selective force operating: for breakdown od a major-gene resistnace the time scale is a few years, while for changes in the response to slighter fitness differences, the time-scales can be anything up to the point where chance takes over(that is, when selective changes are much smaller that chance changes, Chance processes will dominate if selective changes are weaker than about 1(sqrt)Ne, where Ne is the effective population size-likely to be roughly the size of the population in the off season. This is associated with a time-scale of about (sqrt)Ne. Because the generational time-scales are quite short, and the reproductive rate of a pathogen may be greatly influenced by the weather on time-scales of hoursm rapid natural selective changes must be the norm in pathogen populations. if variability is present

The recent emergence of warm adapted yellow rust of wheat (milus et al.2009), however shows that the historica record of the environment limiting a disease may be an unreliable guide to the environments it can adapt to (figure 2) -{\textgreater}This point shows that a early evaluation of rust shows the population of spores reduce at higher temparatures (2001) however a 2009 study shows a more recent rust isolate having increased spore production at elevated tempartures.

in relation to the Beachall study at rothamsted: Although this is not necessarily casual it does illustrate the key problem of predicting disease: the factors controlling the systems are not fully understood(Shaw 2008). This is obvious enough to sound tirvial, so it is worth emphasising that both diseases are intensively studied, aon infect wheat, one of the most intensively studied plants. While there are no doubt still surprises lurking in the climatic processes, the fundamental physics of the climate is far better understood than the population biologt of plant pathogens and this difference need to be empahsised when "best available" predictions are offered to discussions on policy.

Approache to predicting long-term prevalence that start from the basic processes involved require that we have a good understanding of these. At a minimum, they should make possibel food short-term forecasting. Bourgeois et al. (2004) examined a number of pathosystems for which forecasts wwere made available in Canada, concluding that none were reliable enough in a single season to use for long-term prediction with any reasonable confidence.

Furthermore, recent ever seriouse problems with vector borne diseases seem to involve genetivc changes in the pathogen or vector coupled with movement in trade or expansion of the area occupied by a crop, rather than any changes in climate such as improved or altered overwintering (Colvin et al. 2004; Bove 2006)

Climate change at the rate projected for this century will mean that many plants find themselves in climatic zones which are no longer ideal; in consequence, they will be stressed, and disease resistance may be compromised.},

Yield-loss estimates were made by evaluating yield components on tillers collected from commercial fields and sorted by disease severity classes, and by comparing yields for field plots inoculated with F. pseudograminearum with yields in naturally infested soil. Increasing crown rot severity caused an increase in grain protein content and reduction in grain yield, kernels per head, kernel weight, test weight, tiller height, and straw weight. Crown rot reduced winter wheat yield as much as 1,550 kg/ha (35{\%}, {\$}219/ha) in commercial fields, with a 13-field mean of 9.5{\%} ({\$}51/ha). Inoculation reduced yields as much as 2,630 kg/ha (61{\%}, {\$}372/ha) over that caused by the native pathogen flora. Rain-induced crusting of the soil surface greatly amplified preemergence damping-off caused by F. pseudograminearum. Crown rot caused the greatest losses during seasons of lowest precipitation but also damaged crops under wet conditions. Aboveground symptoms were not always apparent under conditions of moderate infection and yield constraint.

abstract = {Atmospheric change studies conducted in free air concentration enrichment (FACE) systems and open-topped chambers have increased understanding of how factors, such as rising CO2 and O3 levels, impact the development of plant disease epidemics. Using these systems, plant scientists have been able to study host/pathogen systems under real-world conditions where variations in multiple environmental parameters impact disease outcomes. Results from these studies are useful for evaluating earlier predictions on plant responses to climate-change parameters and the resulting impacts on plant disease epidemics. Some of these predictions have been verified, whilst others have yet to be tested. Significant interactions among climate-change parameters are highlighting the importance of conducting studies under real-world conditions. The development of molecular and gene expression tools is allowing the fine scale mechanisms responsible for the observed reactions to be determined, and should increase the ability to predict plant disease outcomes under future climatic conditions.},
annote = {Plant disease expression results from a three-way interaction of a susceptible host plant, a virulent pathogen and an environment suitable for disease development; referred to as the disease triangle. Changes in environmental conditions are known to exacerbate plant disease symptoms (Boyer, 1995; McElrone et al., 2001) and are implicated in 44{\%} of new disease emergence (Anderson et al., 2004b).Thus, the altered environmental conditions associated with climatic change (e.g. temperature regimes, atmospheric chemistry and drought) have the potential to alter the incidence and severity of plant disease epidemics and disease pressures on natural and crop plant systems, as well as to reshape the co-evolutionary relationships between plants and pathogens (Chakraborty, 2005; Burdon et al., 2006; Fargette et al., 2006; Ziska{\&}Runion, 2007; Crowl et al., 2008).

Even changes in the host can alter the microenvironment experienced by the pathogen, as canopy density and structure can affect parameters of temperature, moisture and UV light levels at infection sites.

By 2050, CO2 concentrations are expected to double the pre-industrial levels, whilst O3 concentrations are increasing by as much as 2{\AE}5{\%} annually and are expected to reach a global mean of {\textgreater}60 nmol mol)1 (Prather et al., 2001; Vingarzan, 2004; Solomon et al., 2007)

The negative effects of elevated O3 on plant physiology, growth and yield are primarily linked to decreased photosynthetic capacity caused by damage to the photosynthetic biochemical machinery that result in visible lesions, decreased leaf longevity and premature leaf senescence (Sandermann, 1996; Reichenauer et al., 1998; Miller et al., 1999; Long{\&} Naidu, 2002; Morganet al., 2004).

However, when elevated CO2 and O3 are considered in combination, the opposite responses offset for most of the parameters associated with biomass accumulation. Plant height, leaf area, leaf area index, total biomass, ripening and senescence show no significant responses under the combination of conditions, whilst responses of shoot and root biomass and crop yield can be negative but dampened under these conditions (Table 1).

Oxidative bursts caused by acute O3 treatments also affect antagonistic and synergistic interaction between the plant growth regulators ethylene (ET), salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA). Phytohormone- activated defence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging gene transcripts increased in response to O3 because of the oxidative stress O3 induced upon entering the apoplast (Schraudner et al., 1996; Puckette et al., 2009).

Elevated CO2 alters the phenylpropanoid profile as well. However, unlike elevatedO3, elevated CO2 induces production of scopolin and 4- and 5-O-caffeoyl-D-quinic acid (CGA). The increase in these compounds elevates resistance against Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and the fungus Cercospora nicotianae in tobacco (Shadle et al., 2003; Matros et al., 2006).

Boyer (1995) proposed the following two mechanisms to explain how water stress increases the susceptibility of plants to attack by pathogens: (i) reduced photosynthate production induced by drought eliminates the plant's ability to produce defensive compounds; or (ii) plant growth is reduced without reducing the pathogen's ability to reproduce, thus allowing further progression and increased symptom severity in the host.

Also, ABA suppresses phenylpropanoid (PAL) activity and ROS production, which are the major defence processes against pathogens (Ward et al., 1989; McDonald {\&} Cahill, 1999; Audenaert et al., 2002; Asselbergh et al., 2007, 2008).

{\~{}}PDF1.2 (plant defensin 1.2), CHI (chitinase) and HEL (hevein-like ⁄PR-4). These genes were up-regulated in an ABA-deficient mutant and resistance was stronger against Fusarium oxysporum (Anderson et al., 2004a; Mauch-Mani {\&} Mauch, 2005). These examples show that drought can dramatically affect plant defence responses against pathogens

Increasing temperatures from 22 to 28 C reduced the effectiveness of both basal and R-gene mediated resistance in A. thaliana when challenged with virulent and avirulent strains of P. syringae pv. tomato respectively (Wang et al., 2009).

Disease incidence for sweetgum decreased significantly in years with aboveaverage temperatures, and when significant changes did occur, disease incidence and severity always increased under elevated CO2. However, increased disease severity resulting from elevated CO2 was offset by higher photosyntheticefficiency in the remaining undamaged leaf tissues (McElrone et al., 2010)

Focusing on only one factor, such as CO2, may result in conclusions that are not applicable over a range of different environments and conditions (see also Wang{\&}Taub, 2010). The importance of studying host and pathogen responses under combined stress conditions is well illus- Climatic change and host–pathogen interactions illustrated by the offsetting effects of concurrent elevated CO2 and O3 on host plant responses (Table 1).

or example, a study looking at the effects of elevated CO2, nitrogen application and water supply on powdery mildew on wheat showed that levels of disease severity were reduced in the elevated- CO2 environment. However, mildew levels increased with increasing leaf nitrogen concentrations and were reduced with increased leaf water content (Thompson et al., 1993). In fact, the authors assert that the result of this study showed that the reason that mildew levels were lower in the elevated-CO2 environment was that the elevated CO2 levels caused the nitrogen levels in the leaf tissue to decline and the water content to increase, and that the water content factor had the greatest influence on mildew severity.},

The symptoms and distribution of this decline are described. P cinnamomi is a primary pathogen on a very wide range of trees and woody ornamentals worldwide, but is probably a native of the Papua New Guinea region. It is soil borne and requires warm, wet soils to infect roots. Since 1900 it has caused major epidemics on native chestnuts in the United States and Europe, and now threatens the stability of entire forest and heath communities ecosystems in some parts of Australia. Together with drought, ii may be a major predisposing factor in the Iberian oak decline. Its possible role in this decline including its interaction with drought is discussed, and a generalised working hypothesis of decline is presented. The potential influence of climate warming on the activity of P cinnamomi, Is also considered. A model based on the CLIMEX program suggests that warming would significantly enhance the activity of the pathogen at its existing disease locations (such as the western Mediterranean and coastal northwest Europe), but that it would not greatly extend its activity into areas with cold winters such as central and eastern Europe.},

abstract = {Numerous pathogenic Fusarium species have well-characterized sexual cycles, whereas others, including the crown rot fungus F. pseudograminearum, do not. We conducted studies to elucidate the potential frequency and nature of sexual reproduction in field populations of F. pseudograminearum and developed tester strains for controlled crossings under laboratory conditions. Studies on the role of sexual recombination in the life cycle of F. pseudograminearum revealed apparently low levels of female fertility under controlled laboratory conditions, despite the observation of naturally occurring perithecia of the teleomorph Gibberella coronicola at two field sites. Female fertility levels were experimentally increased to produce female fertile tester strains using four generations of single and multi-stage crossings between sibling progeny derived from fertile laboratory crosses between field isolates collected in northeastern Australia. The production of reliable female fertile tester strains has potential applications for the construction of biological species boundaries, elucidation of the physical characters of reproductive structures, and the generation of genetic diversity via sexual recombination in F. pseudograminearum. As such, the current study is a significant advancement in the understanding of G. coronicola, allowing for future characterisation of various biological, epidemiological, and genetic parameters. {\textcopyright} 2008 The British Mycological Society.},

abstract = {This paper describes the effects of elevated CO2 and N fertilization on soils planted with ponderosa pine (Pinus Ponderosa) seedlings in short-term greenhouse studies. The high degree of homogeneity in the soils used allowed sensitive evaluation of soil changes in response to treatments. Elevated CO2 had no detectable effect upon soil N availability, but both CO2 and N fertilization caused significant changes in soil available (NH4F/HCl-extractable) P. Some of these changes could be accounted for by plant uptake, some were apparently due to differences in P immobilization (biotic or abiotic). N fertilization caused reductions in exchangeable K, Ca and Mg which could not be accounted for by plant uptake and were probably due to increased leaching. None of the reductions in soil available nutrients observed were of sufficient magnitude to cause nutrient deficiencies over the approximate 1-year duration of these studies.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of endogenous small non-coding RNAs that play important roles in plant growth, development, and stress response processes. Verticillium wilt is a vascular disease in plants mainly caused by Verticillium dahliae Kleb., the soil-borne fungal pathogen. However, the role of miRNAs in the regulation of Verticillium defense responses is mostly unknown. This study aimed to identify new miRNAs and their potential targets that are involved in the regulation of Verticillium defense responses. Four small RNA libraries and two degradome libraries from mock-infected and infected roots of cotton (both Gossypium hirsutum L. and Gossypium barbadense L.) were constructed for deep sequencing. A total of 140 known miRNAs and 58 novel miRNAs were identified. Among the identified miRNAs, many were differentially expressed between libraries. Degradome analysis showed that a total of 83 and 24 genes were the targets of 31 known and 14 novel miRNA families, respectively. Gene Ontology analysis indicated that many of the identified miRNA targets may function in controlling root development and the regulation of Verticillium defense responses in cotton. Our findings provide an overview of potential miRNAs involved in the regulation of Verticillium defense responses in cotton and the interactions between miRNAs and their corresponding targets. The profiling of these miRNAs lays the foundation for further understanding of the function of small RNAs in regulating plant response to fungal infection and Verticillium wilt in particular.},

Under Such conditions. there is high probability that forests will be Subject to increased frequency and intensity of stress due to climatic extremes. Therefore. impacts of climate change On forest health Should be carefully evaluated. Given these assumptions, several fungal diseases on trees may become more devastating because of the following factors: (i) abiotic Stresses. Such as drought and flooding, are known to predispose trees to several pathogens (ii) temperature and Moisture affect pathogen sporulation and dispersal. and changes in climatic conditions are likely to favour certain pathogens; (iii) migration of pathogens triggered by climatic change may increase disease incidence or geographical range, when pathogens encounter new hosts and (or) new potential vectors and (iv) new threats may appear either because of it change in tree species composition or because of invasive species. If infection success is dependent on temperature, higher mean temperatures may lead to more attacks. Pathogens that have been of importance in southern Europe may spread northward and also upward to mountains. Pathogens with evolutionary potential for greater damage Should be identified to estimate magnitude of the threat and to prepare for the changing conditions. A review of the above-mentioned cases is presented. Some priorities to improve the ability to predict impacts of climate change on tree diseases are discussed.},

@article{Birch1948,
abstract = {The parameter known as the intrinsic rate of natural increase, which was developed for demographic analyses by A. J. Lotka, is introduced as a useful concept for the study of insect populations. It is suggested that for the sake of uniformity of terminology in population biology and for precision of definition, that the term `intrinsic rate of natural increase' might be considered more appropriate than an alternative term `biotic-potential' which is more frequently used in relation to insect populations. The intrinsic rate of natural increase is defined as the exponent `r' in the exponential equation for population increase in an unlimited environment. The rate of increase of such a population is given by dN/dt=rN. The parameter r refers to the rate of increase of a population with a certain fixed age distribution known as the stable age distribution. Both the intrinsic rate of natural increase and the stable age distribution may be calculated from the age-specific survival rates (life table) and age-specific fecundity rates. The methods of calculation are exemplified with data for the rice weevil, Calandra oryzae (L.), and some adapted from the flour beetle, Tribolium confusum Duval. It is shown in this example that the intrinsic rate of natural increase is determined to a much greater extent by the rate of oviposition in the first 2 weeks of adult life than by the total number of eggs laid in the entire life time. The oviposition rates in the first 2 weeks account for 85{\%} of the value of r whereas only 27{\%} of the total number of eggs are laid in that time. With each successive week in the life of the adult, eggs laid make a lessened contribution to the value of r. The methods of calculation of r provide a means of determining the extent to which the various components--the life table, the fecundity table and the length of the pre-reproductive stages--enter into the value of r. It is suggested that analyses of this sort may provide a clue to the life patterns characteristic of different species. The importance of the age distribution of populations which initiate seasonal increase in the autumn and spring is discussed. These age distributions depend on the nature of the overwintering or over-summering stage. It is suggested that this particular stage, whether it be adult, larva, pupa or egg, has been selected by virtue not only of its resistance to the unfavourable season, but also in relation to its merits in initiating rapid establishment of a population in the succeeding season. It is shown how the value of r for Calandra oryzae varies with temperature. Four other parameters are also defined: the net reproduction rate, the mean length of a generation, the infinitesimal birth-rate and the infinitesimal death-rate. The methods of calculation of these parameters are also exemplified with data for C. oryzae.},

abstract = {Dynamic crop-growth models are used to project the effects of rising atmospheric CO2 concentration and associated climate change on crop yields. Such model predictions are largely untested in the field, for lack of experimental data. We tested the CERES-Wheat model, modified to include leaf-level photosynthesis response to elevated CO2, using field data from 2 yr of Free-Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) experiments with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Yecora Rojo) in Mariclopa, AZ. Two irrigation treatments (well-watered, WW; water-deficit stressed, WS) and two atmospheric CO2 concentrations (ambient, 350 mu mol mol(-1); elevated, 550 mu mol mol(-1)) were simulated. The model was evaluated using measurements of crop phenology, aboveground dry matter (DM) production, grain yield, and evapotranspiration (ET). Model calculations of crop phenology were within 2 to 3 d of observed values under WW, ambient CO2 conditions in both years. The model did not simulate the accelerated crop phenology (5-8 d at physiological maturity) observed in the WW and elevated CO2 treatments, indicating the need to include effects of increased stomatal resistance on canopy temperature. Simulations of DM and grain yield were within 10{\%} of measured values, except for a tendency to overcalculate DM response to CO2 by 10 to 15{\%} in Year 1 for WS treatments. The model undercalculated cumulative ET under WW conditions by 15{\%}; model sensitivity analyses suggest that simulation of potential evapotranspiration (PET) was too low for this arid site. The model reproduced measured dynamics of CO2-water interactions. Simulated reductions in water loss due to elevated CO2 were about 4{\%}, in agreement with measurements. The model simulated larger increases in DM production and yield due to elevated CO2 under WS than under WW conditions. In Year 1, simulated crop response to CO2 was 2{\%} larger (measured: 3{\%}) under WS than under WW conditions; in Year 2, it was 11{\%} larger (measured: 9{\%}). The ability to simulate CO2-water interactions, though it needs to be further evaluated with additional experimental datasets, is an important attribute of models used to project crop yields under elevated CO2 and climate change.},

abstract = {Genetic variation among isolates of Beauveria spp. was defined by an analysis of electrophoretically demonstrable allelic variations of allozyme coding genes. One hundred and forty-six isolates from diverse geographical locations were assigned to forty-seven distinctive genotypic classes. Clustering analysis demonstrated that four morphological species (B. brongniartii, B. vermiconia, B. caledonica and Tolypocladium cylindrosporum) were genetically distinct from each other. However, with the exception of B. brongniartii, which clustered separately with B. amorpha, they were not clearly resolved from lines of B. bassiana. The level of genetic distance shown between cluster groups of B. bassiana indicated that it represents a species aggregate, components of which display overlapping genetic variability with isolates currently assigned to other species. All isolates were homozygous at each locus, consistent with haploidy, except for B. caledonica, which was heterozygous at one of the four loci. In spite of the maintenance of high diversity in B. bassiana, three geographically widespread genotypic classes were found to contain the majority of isolates. This suggests that, in many situations, B. bassiana exists with a clonal population structure. Various other aspects of the allozyme data (the magnitude of genetic distances between populations, gene diversity, and the pattern of distribution of genotypic classes) indicate that chromosomal recombination between different genotypes of B. bassiana spp. is rare or absent.},

abstract = {Spatial epidemiology is the description and analysis of geographic variations in disease with respect to demographic, environmental, behavioral, socioeconomic, genetic, and infectious risk factors. We focus on small-area analyses, encompassing disease mapping, geographic correlation studies, disease clusters, and clustering. Advances in geographic information systems, statistical methodology, and availability of high-resolution, geographically referenced health and environmental quality data have created unprecedented new opportunities to investigate environmental and other factors in explaining local geographic variations in disease. They also present new challenges. Problems include the large random component that may predominate disease rates across small areas. Though this can be dealt with appropriately using Bayesian statistics to provide smooth estimates of disease risks, sensitivity to detect areas at high risk is limited when expected numbers of cases are small. Potential biases and confounding, particularly due to socioeconomic factors, and a detailed understanding of data quality are important. Data errors can result in large apparent disease excess in a locality. Disease cluster reports often arise nonsystematically because of media, physician, or public concern. One ready means of investigating such concerns is the replication of analyses in different areas based on routine data, as is done in the United Kingdom through the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (and increasingly in other European countries, e.g., through the European Health and Environment Information System collaboration). In the future, developments in exposure modeling and mapping, enhanced study designs, and new methods of surveillance of large health databases promise to improve our ability to understand the complex relationships of environment to health.},

Mercia between anthesis and harvest was determined in a computer-controlled environment facility in 1993 and 1994. In both years the total fungal populations (cm(2) leaf) were found to have increased due to exposure to either elevated CO2 and elevated CO2 + temperature treatments. This was mainly due to significant increases in populations of Cladosporium spp. (C. cladosporioides and C. herbarum) on the flag leaves during ripening. Other phyllosphere component species such as white and pink yeasts were not markedly affected by treatments. The range of fungal species found in such controlled environment chambers was narrower than that commonly found on nag leaves of field grown crops. Common and important colonisers of leaves and ripening ears such as Aureobasidium pullulans, Epicoccum nigrum and Fusarium spp. were seldom isolated.},

abstract = {Growing concern over the potentially devastating impacts of climate change on biodiversity and food security, considered together with the growing world population, means that taking action to conserve crop wild relative (CWR) diversity is no longer an option-it is an urgent priority. Crop wild relatives are species closely related to crops, including their progenitors, which have the potential to contribute beneficial traits for crop improvement, such as biotic and abiotic resistances, leading to improved yield and stability. Having already made major contributions to crop improvement in the 20th century, CWR are recognized as acritical resource to sustain global food security; therefore, their systematic conservation is imperative. However, extending their conservation and promoting more systematic exploitation is hindered by a lack of understanding of their current and potential value, their diversity, and practically how they might be conserved. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to (i) demonstrate the current and potential use of CWR in crop improvement, (ii) estimate how many CWR species exist and how many are a global priority for active conservation, and (iii) describe how a global network for the in situ conservation of CWR might be established that could help to underpin future food security.},

@article{Tunali2012a,
abstract = {Crown rot and head blight of wheat are caused by the same Fusarium species. To better understand their biology, this study has compared 30 isolates of the three dominant species using 13 pathogenic and saprophytic fitness measures including aggressiveness for the two diseases, saprophytic growth and fecundity and deoxynivalenol (DON) production from saprophytic colonization of grain and straw. Pathogenic fitness was generally linked to DON production in infected tissue. The superior crown rot fitness of Fusarium pseudograminearum was linked to high DON production in the stem base tissue, while Fusarium culmorum and Fusarium graminearum had superior head blight fitness with high DON production in grains. Within each species, some isolates had similar aggressiveness for both diseases but differed in DON production in infected tissue to indicate that more than one mechanism controlled aggressiveness. All three species produced more DON when infecting living host tissue compared with saprophytic colonization of grain or straw, but there were significant links between these saprophytic fitness components and aggressiveness. As necrotrophic pathogens spend a part of their life cycle on dead organic matter, saprophytic fitness is an important component of their overall fitness. Any management strategy must target weaknesses in both pathogenic fitness and saprophytic fitness.},

abstract = {The sensitivity of yield and quality parameters to carbon dioxide concentration [CO2] was determined for individual lines of hard-red spring wheat released in 1903, 1921, 1965 and 1996. All cultivars were evaluated with respect to growth and vegetative characteristics, grain yield and nutritional quality in response to [CO2] increases that corresponded roughly to the CO2 concentrations at the beginning of the 20th century, the current [CO2], and the future projected [CO2] for the end of the 21st century, respectively. Leaf area ratio (cm(2) g(-1)) declined and net assimilation rate (g m(2) day(-1)) increased in response to increasing [CO2] for all cultivars during early vegetative growth. By maturity, vegetative growth of all cultivars significantly increased with the increase in [CO2]. Seed yield increased significantly as [CO2] increased, with yield sensitivity to rising [CO2] inversely proportional to the year of cultivar release. Greater [CO2] yield sensitivity in older cultivars was associated with whole-plant characteristics such as increased tillering and panicle formation. Grain and flour protein, however, declined significantly with increasing [CO2] and with year of release for all cultivars, although absolute values were higher for the older cultivars. Overall, these data indicate that yield response at the whole-plant level to recent and projected increases in [CO2] has declined with the release of newer cultivars, as has protein content of grain and flour. However, if agronomic practice can be adapted to maximize individual plant performance, [CO2] responsive characteristics of older cultivars could, potentially, be incorporated as factors in future wheat selection.},

In this report, PlxyGV-SA was further charac-terised by PCR amplification and sequencing of egt, lef-8 and lef-9 genes, and several amino acid substi-tutions were observed. The PstI REN profile of PlxyGV-SA was different from that of PlxyGV-Japan in terms of band size and number, thereby confirming its novel genetic identity. Surface dose bioassays showed that PlxyGV-SA is pathogenic to neonate but not late instar larvae at the same and higher virus doses, indicating that a biopesticide should be targeted at early larval stages in the field.},

abstract = {* A large database of invasive forest pathogens (IFPs) was developed to investigate the patterns and determinants of invasion in Europe. * Detailed taxonomic and biological information on the invasive species was combined with country-specific data on land use, climate, and the time since invasion to identify the determinants of invasiveness, and to differentiate the class of environments which share territorial and climate features associated with a susceptibility to invasion. * IFPs increased exponentially in the last four decades. Until 1919, IFPs already present moved across Europe. Then, new IFPs were introduced mainly from North America, and recently from Asia. Hybrid pathogens also appeared. Countries with a wider range of environments, higher human impact or international trade hosted more IFPs. Rainfall influenced the diffusion rates. Environmental conditions of the new and original ranges and systematic and ecological attributes affected invasiveness. * Further spread of established IFPs is expected in countries that have experienced commercial isolation in the recent past. Densely populated countries with high environmental diversity may be the weakest links in attempts to prevent new arrivals. Tight coordination of actions against new arrivals is needed. Eradication seems impossible, and prevention seems the only reliable measure, although this will be difficult in the face of global mobility.},

abstract = {Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration not only has a direct impact on plants but also affects plant-pathogen interactions. Due to economic and health-related problems, special concern was given thus in the present work to the effect of elevated CO2 (750 mumol mol-1) level on the Fusarium culmorum infection and mycotoxin contamination of wheat. Despite the fact that disease severity was found to be not or little affected by elevated CO2 in most varieties, as the spread of Fusarium increased only in one variety, spike grain number and/or grain weight decreased significantly at elevated CO2 in all the varieties, indicating that Fusarium infection generally had a more dramatic impact on the grain yield at elevated CO2 than at the ambient level. Likewise, grain deoxynivalenol (DON) content was usually considerably higher at elevated CO2 than at the ambient level in the single-floret inoculation treatment, suggesting that the toxin content is not in direct relation to the level of Fusarium infection. In the whole-spike inoculation, DON production did not change, decreased or increased depending on the variety x experiment interaction. Cooler (18 degrees C) conditions delayed rachis penetration while 20 degrees C maximum temperature caused striking increases in the mycotoxin contents, resulting in extremely high DON values and also in a dramatic triggering of the grain zearalenone contamination at elevated CO2. The results indicate that future environmental conditions, such as rising CO2 levels, may increase the threat of grain mycotoxin contamination.},

abstract = {Disease incidence and severity was studied for winter wheat variety Bezostaya 1 and susceptible checks based on data from international nurseries from 1969 to 2010 and from 51 countries across major winter wheat production regions totalling 1,047 reports. The frequency of leaf rust and stripe rust occurrence was stable over time with marked increases in severity in 2001-2010 especially in Europe and Central and West Asia. Substantial global reductions in stem rust occurrence were recorded and attributed primarily to use of resistance genes although the recent emergence of race Ug99 makes wheat more vulnerable. The occurrence of powdery mildew remained globally stable over time. It was the most important foliar disease in Western and Southern Europe, where the frequency was very high for all time periods coupled with slight increases in severity during 2001-2010. The durable resistance of variety Bezostaya 1 to all four diseases was demonstrated in the study using comparisons of disease severities of Bezostaya 1 and the most susceptible entries. The Lr34/Yr18/Pm38 pleiotrophic set possessed by Bezostaya 1 is currently an important target for selection because it is now amenable to molecular selection. Increased use of genes like Lr34 combined with strategies to minimize cultivation of extremely susceptible varieties will contribute to long term maintenance of low and non-damaging disease levels. The durable disease resistance of Bezostaya 1, combined with its adaptability and good end-use quality, was a significant reason for its huge impact in agriculture over the last 50 years.},

abstract = {Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) plants were exposed to free-air CO2 enriched (FACE = 550 mumol mol-1) or ambient (CONTROL = 370 mumol mol-1) levels of atmospheric CO2 and to wet (100{\%} of evapotranspiration replaced) or dry (67{\%} of ET replaced) soil water content treatments. Foliar, soil and root samples were collected in June and August 1991 to determine the effects of elevated CO2 on selected groups of phyllosphere and rhizosphere microorganisms. Foliage and rhizosphere soil were analyzed for bacteria and/or fungi using dilution plating. Mycorrhizal colonization of cotton roots was assessed. Root-zone soil was analyzed for populations of nematodes, microarthropods and Rhizoctonia using various extraction methods. A dehydrogenase assay for total microbial respiration and a bioassay for cotton root infecting organisms were also conducted using root-zone soil. Populations of fungi on cotton leaves varied, by genera, in response to CO2 enrichment, but none was affected by soil water content treatments; populations of foliar bacteria were not affected by either CO2 or soil water content treatments. In August, higher total numbers of rhizosphere fungi were found under the wet compared with the dry soil water treatment, but differences related to CO2 were not detected. There was a trend for infestation by Rhizoctonia solani to be higher under FACE in the August sample, but the soil bioassay demonstrated no increase in damping-off potential. There was a significant interaction between CO2 concentration and soil water content for populations of saprophagous nematodes; populations were different between the CO2 levels in the dry soil treatment only, with higher numbers under FACE. Microarthropod numbers were low; however, there was a trend for Collembola populations to be higher under FACE in the August sample and more fungi were isolated from Collembola in June. Total microbial activity was higher under FACE at both sample dates. Effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on plant-microbe interactions could have profound influence on the productivity of agro-ecosystems, and deserve further research.},

abstract = {A rising global population and demand for protein-rich diets are increasing pressure to maximize agricultural productivity. Rising atmospheric [CO2] is altering global temperature and precipitation patterns, which challenges agricultural productivity. While rising [CO2] provides a unique opportunity to increase the productivity of C-3 crops, average yield stimulation observed to date is well below potential gains. Thus, there is room for improving productivity. However, only a fraction of available germplasm of crops has been tested for CO2 responsiveness. Yield is a complex phenotypic trait determined by the interactions of a genotype with the environment. Selection of promising genotypes and characterization of response mechanisms will only be effective if crop improvement and systems biology approaches are closely linked to production environments, that is, on the farm within major growing regions. Free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments can provide the platform upon which to conduct genetic screening and elucidate the inheritance and mechanisms that underlie genotypic differences in productivity under elevated [CO2]. We propose a new generation of large-scale, low-cost per unit area FACE experiments to identify the most CO2-responsive genotypes and provide starting lines for future breeding programmes. This is necessary if we are to realize the potential for yield gains in the future.},

abstract = {In this paper, we review historical and contemporary species concepts and species recognition criteria for plant pathogenic fungi. Previous incongruent and unstable classification based on subjective and changing criteria have led to some confusion, especially amongst plant pathologists. The goal of systematics is to provide an informative and robust framework that stands the test of time. The taxonomic histories of Cercospora, Colletotrichum, Fusarium, as well as the rust and smut fungi, are used as examples, to show how concepts and criteria used to delimit and recognize species have changed. Through these examples we compare the Genealogical Concordance Phylogenetic Species Recognition, an extension of the Phylogenetic Species Criterion, with other species recognition criteria and show that it provides a better discrimination for delimiting species. A rapidly increasing number of cryptic species are being discovered amongst plant pathogenic fungi using the Genealogical Concordance Phylogenetic Species Recognition, and it is important to determine their host range, the severity of diseases they cause and their biosecurity significance. With rapidly expanding global trade it has become imperative that we develop effective and reliable protocols to detect these previously unrecognized pathogens.},

abstract = {Comparative analyses of pathogen genomes provide new insights into how pathogens have evolved common and divergent virulence strategies to invade related plant species. Fusarium crown and root rots are important diseases of wheat and barley world-wide. In Australia, these diseases are primarily caused by the fungal pathogen Fusarium pseudograminearum. Comparative genomic analyses showed that the F. pseudograminearum genome encodes proteins that are present in other fungal pathogens of cereals but absent in non-cereal pathogens. In some cases, these cereal pathogen specific genes were also found in bacteria associated with plants. Phylogenetic analysis of selected F. pseudograminearum genes supported the hypothesis of horizontal gene transfer into diverse cereal pathogens. Two horizontally acquired genes with no previously known role in fungal pathogenesis were studied functionally via gene knockout methods and shown to significantly affect virulence of F. pseudograminearum on the cereal hosts wheat and barley. Our results indicate using comparative genomics to identify genes specific to pathogens of related hosts reveals novel virulence genes and illustrates the importance of horizontal gene transfer in the evolution of plant infecting fungal pathogens.},

Results indicate South Asia and Southern Africa as two regions that, without sufficient adaptation measures, will likely suffer negative impacts on several crops that are important to large food-insecure human populations. We also find that uncertainties vary widely by crop, and therefore priorities will depend on the risk attitudes of investment institutions.},

abstract = {Spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Scarlett) was grown at two CO2 levels (400 vs. 700 ppm) combined with two ozone regimes (ambient vs. double ambient) in climate chambers for four weeks, beginning at seedling emergence. Elevated CO2 concentration significantly increased aboveground biomass, root biomass, and tiller number, whereas double ambient ozone significantly decreased these parameters. These ozone-induced reductions in growth parameters were strongly overridden by 700 ppm CO2. The elevated CO2 level increased C: N ratio of the leaf tissue and leaf starch content but decreased leaf protein levels. Exposure to double ambient ozone did not affect protein content and C:N ratio but dramatically increased leaf starch levels at 700 ppm CO2. Resistance against Drechslera teres (Sacc.) Shoemaker was increased in leaves grown at double ambient ozone but was less obvious at 700 ppm than at 400 ppm CO2. Constitutive activities of beta-1,3-glucanase and chitinase were significantly higher in leaves grown at double ambient ozone compared to ambient ozone levels. The sum of methanol-soluble and alkali-released cell wall-bound aromatic metabolites (i.e., C-glycosylflavones and several structurally unidentified metabolites) and lignin contents did not show any treatment-dependent differences.},

The article focuses in depth on how climatic variables affect fungal infection and production of specific mycotoxins in food crops, and how near-future climatic changes will shape the prevalence of these mycotoxins in crops in different parts of the world. Because of regulatory limits set on maximum allowable levels of mycotoxins in food and feed, growers will experience economic losses if climatic factors cause certain mycotoxins to become more prevalent.

One pair of primers is capable of amplifying nearly full-length 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) from many bacterial genera; the additional primers are useful for various exceptional sequences. Methods for purification of amplified material, direct sequencing, cloning, sequencing, and transcription are outlined. An obligate intracellular parasite of bovine erythrocytes, Anaplasma marginale, is used as an example; its 16S rDNA was amplified, cloned, sequenced, and phylogenetically placed. Anaplasmas are related to the genera Rickettsia and Ehrlichia. In addition, 16S rDNAs from several species were readily amplified from material found in lyophilized ampoules from the American Type Culture Collection. By use of this method, the phylogenetic study of extremely fastidious or highly pathogenic bacterial species can be carried out without the need to culture them. In theory, any gene segment for which polymerase chain reaction primer design is possible can be derived from a readily obtainable lyophilized bacterial culture.},

The beetles from each source population experienced selection cycles with O3 using the lethal time for 80{\%} (LT80) of the insect population from each generation. The O3 toxicity (50 ppm at a continuous flow rate of 2 L min-1) to each generation was calculated using time-response bioassays.

abstract = {Climate change biology is witnessing a significant quantity of new publications each year, which compromises efforts to keep up-to-date on the rapidly growing body of climate change biology literature. The present paper provides an overview on research approaches and challenges in climate change biology with respect to plant pathogens, insect pests and weeds (collectively termed 'pests' here). It also summarizes the suggestions of researchers about how to conceptualize and prioritize future research strategies. Recently published key studies demonstrate that climate change research is qualitatively advancing and that the interactions among environmental and biotic factors which have been found are complex. This complexity hinders attempts to generalize responses of pests to changes in climate. The challenge remains to identify the most significant causal relationships and to separate them from other factors such as crop management practices, which may also influence the observed changes in pest distribution and prevalence in managed ecosystems. In addition, the present overview shows that there are still gaps in many research areas, while other fields have been intensively investigated. For example, the identification of potential benefits in plant protection that may emerge from future climate change has not been explored as extensively as the potential threats. However, encouraging developments can be observed in recent climate change research, for instance the increased number of studies performed under subtropical and tropical climatic conditions, the increased availability of results from multi-factorial field experiments and modelling studies do consider increasingly pest-crop-climate interactions. Further progress can be expected, provided that researchers, sponsors and other stakeholders maintain their interest in climate change biology research.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Fusarium wilt of banana (also known as Panama disease) is caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense. Where susceptible cultivars are grown, management is limited to the use of pathogen-free planting stock and clean soils. Resistant genotypes exist for some applications, but resistance is still needed in other situations. Progress has been made with this recalcitrant crop by traditional and nontraditional improvement programs. The disease was first reported in Australia in 1876, but did the greatest damage in export plantations in the western tropics before 1960. A new variant, tropical race 4, threatens the trades that are now based on Cavendish cultivars, and other locally important types such as the plantains. Phylogenetic studies indicate that F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense had several independent evolutionary origins. The significance of these results and the future impact of this disease are discussed.},

At elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations, where plant nitrogen content was significantly reduced, the severity of mildew infection was significantly reduced, and where host water content was significantly increased, the severity of mildew infection was significantly increased. In a moderate water supply treatment, the plants grown in elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations had significantly reduced nitrogen contents (9.9{\%}) and significantly increased water content (4{\%}), the amount of mildew infection was unchanged. The severity of mildew infection appeared to be more sensitive to host water content than to host nitrogen content.},

abstract = {Fusarium culmorum is a major pathogen of wheat and barley causing head blight and crown rot in cooler temperate climates of Australia, Europe, West Asia and North Africa. To better understand its evolutionary history we partially sequenced single copy nuclear genes encoding translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF), reductase (RED) and phosphate permease (PHO) in 100 F. culmorum isolates with 11 isolates of Fusarium crookwellense, Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium pseudograminearum. Phylogenetic analysis of multilocus sequence (MLS) data using Bayesian inference and maximum parsimony analysis showed that F. culmorum from wheat is a single phylogenetic species with no significant linkage disequilibrium and little or no lineage development along geographic origin. Both MLS and TEF and RED gene sequence analysis separated the four Fusarium species used and delineated three to four groups within the F. culmorum clade. But the PHO gene could not completely resolve isolates into their respective species. Fixation index and gene flow suggest significant genetic exchange between the isolates from distant geographic regions. A lack of strong lineage structure despite the geographic separation of the three collections indicates a frequently recombining species and/or widespread distribution of genotypes due to international trade, tourism and long-range dispersal of macroconidia. Moreover, the two mating type genes were present in equal proportion among the F. culmorum collection used in this study, leaving open the possibility of sexual reproduction.

abstract = {Fusarium species are among the most commonly occurring and economically important member of micro-fungi. The aim of this study was to estimate the genetic diversity and relationship among 29 isolates of F. semitectum collected from various cereals and locations in the north of Iran by using morphological characters and RAPD-PCR polymorphisms. Based on morphological studies the isolates were divided into two distinct groups A and B. Microscopic characters (shape of macroconidia and presence of sporodochia and chlamydospore) of group A varied between isolates and lead to this group divided into two subgroups. Using eight polymorphic primers, 82 RAPD fragments were obtained with an average of 10 polymorphic bands per primer. Cluster analysis with UPGMA revealed three distinct arbitrary level of 50{\%} similarity. Majority of isolates of group A were homogenous having similar DNA patterns. There were low levels of genetic difference among isolates of morphotype A while two of them (28 and 29) have a different banding pattern. Genetic estimates demonstrated that the isolates from morphotype A were significantly distinct from morphotype B isolates. Results of cluster analysis using RAPD data did not show any correlation with geographical distribution but the results of this analysis confirmed a genetic variation among all isolates.

The recent convergence of molecular studies of plant immunity and pathogen infection strategies is revealing an integrated picture of the plant-pathogen interaction from the perspective of both organisms. Plants have an amazing capacity to recognize pathogens through strategies involving both conserved and variable pathogen elicitors, and pathogens manipulate the defence response through secretion of virulence effector molecules. These insights suggest novel biotechnological approaches to crop protection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Development of Verticillium wilt in olive, caused by the soil-borne fungus Verticillium dahliae, can be influenced by biotic and environmental factors. In this study we modeled i) the combined effects of biotic factors (i.e., pathotype virulence and cultivar susceptibility) and abiotic factors (i.e., soil temperature) on disease development and ii) the relationship between disease severity and several remote sensing parameters and plant stress indicators. METHODOLOGY: Plants of Arbequina and Picual olive cultivars inoculated with isolates of defoliating and non-defoliating V. dahliae pathotypes were grown in soil tanks with a range of soil temperatures from 16 to 32°C. Disease progression was correlated with plant stress parameters (i.e., leaf temperature, steady-state chlorophyll fluorescence, photochemical reflectance index, chlorophyll content, and ethylene production) and plant growth-related parameters (i.e., canopy length and dry weight). FINDINGS: Disease development in plants infected with the defoliating pathotype was faster and more severe in Picual. Models estimated that infection with the defoliating pathotype was promoted by soil temperatures in a range of 16 to 24°C in cv. Picual and of 20 to 24°C in cv. Arbequina. In the non-defoliating pathotype, soil temperatures ranging from 16 to 20°C were estimated to be most favorable for infection. The relationship between stress-related parameters and disease severity determined by multinomial logistic regression and classification trees was able to detect the effects of V. dahliae infection and colonization on water flow that eventually cause water stress. CONCLUSIONS: Chlorophyll content, steady-state chlorophyll fluorescence, and leaf temperature were the best indicators for Verticillium wilt detection at early stages of disease development, while ethylene production and photochemical reflectance index were indicators for disease detection at advanced stages. These results provide a better understanding of the differential geographic distribution of V. dahliae pathotypes and to assess the potential effect of climate change on Verticillium wilt development.},

abstract = {A multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed using published primers to simultaneously detect three viruses infecting potato (Potato yellow vein virus, Tomato infectious chlorosis virus and Tobacco rattle virus), including an internal amplification control. The characteristics of the published primers were analysed to see if they could be used for multiplex RT-PCR. Amplification of the three target viruses and a plant internal control was then optimized by adding bovine serum albumin during cDNA synthesis, increasing the PCR extension time, reducing the PCR extension temperature and optimizing the concentration of each pair of primers. This optimization produced a multiplex assay with a detection sensitivity of the same order as simplex RT-PCR. This approach provides a simple and convenient way to develop multiplex assays using published primers directly rather than designing new primers. The multiplex RT-PCR is a sensitive and cost-effective method for detecting multiple viruses in potato and can be used for quarantine and certification programmes.

abstract = {A recent assessment by the intergovernmental panel on climate change concluded that the Earth's climate would be 2–6 °C warmer than in the pre-industrial era by the end of the twenty-first century, due to human-induced increases in greenhouse gases. In the absence of other changes, this would lead to the warmest period on Earth for at least the last 1000 years, and probably the last 100 000 years. The large-scale warming is expected to be accompanied by increased frequency and/or intensity of extreme events, such as heatwaves, heavy rainfall, storms and coastal flooding. There are also several possibilities that this large change could initiate nonlinear climate responses which lead to even more extreme and rapid (on the time-scale of decades) climate change, including the collapse of the ocean ‘conveyor belt' circulation, the collapse of major ice sheets or the release of large amounts of methane in high latitudes leading to further global warming. Although these catastrophic events are much more speculative than the direct warming due to increased greenhouse gases, their potential impacts are great and therefore should be included in any risk assessment of the impacts of anthropogenic climate change.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT One plant genotype displays a resistance phenotype at one development stage but a susceptible reaction to the same pathogen at another stage, which is referred to here as resistance inversion. In wheat, Fusarium head blight (FHB)-resistant cv. Sumai3 showed a Fusarium seedling blight (FSB)-susceptible reaction whereas FHB-susceptible cv. Annong8455 exhibited FSB resistance when challenged with a Fusarium asiaticum strain that produces deoxynivalenol (DON). The resistance to FHB and FSB in wheat was closely associated with expression of a plant cytochrome P450 gene in response to FHB pathogens and mycotoxins. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that expression of nine defense-related genes in spikes and seedlings was induced by the fungal infection, in which a massive accumulation of a plant cytochrome P450 gene, CYP709C1, was clearly associated with the resistance reaction in both seedling and spike. The FHB-resistant Sumai3 accumulated 7-fold more P450 transcripts than did the FHB-susceptible Annong8455, while 84-fold more P450 transcripts were accumulated in the FSB-resistant Annong8455 than the FSB-susceptible Sumai3. A Fusarium strain with a disrupted Tri5 gene, which is not able to produce the first enzyme essential for trichothecene mycotoxin biosynthesis, also induced more P450 transcripts in FHB- and FSB-resistant cultivars. The fungal activation of the P450 gene was more profound in the FSB-resistant reaction than the FHB-resistant reaction relative to their susceptible counterparts. DON triggered a differential expression of the P450 gene with comparable patterns in spikes and seedlings in a resistance-dependent manner. These results may provide a basis for dissecting mechanisms underlying FHB and FSB resistance reactions in wheat and revealing functions of the cytochrome P450 in plant detoxification and defense.},

abstract = {Crown rot caused by Fusarium pseudograminearum reduces the yield of wheat (Triticum aestivum) in Oregon. Observations of crown rot symptoms in traditional breeding and yield testing nurseries have not been useful for describing tolerance ratings of wheat cultivars. Yield data from inoculated experiments were therefore evaluated to determine if differences in cultivar response could be identified. A comparison of yields in inoculated and noninoculated plots wits made for one group of spring wheat entries and four groups of winter wheat entries. Significant differences among spring wheat entries were identified and were validated against standards for tolerance and intolerance to F pseudograminearum in Australia. Locally adapted and Australian standards exhibited a comparable range of yield reduction due to inoculation. Spring wheat tolerance reactions can be accurately described using as few as 24 yield comparisons. However. this screening method will not be practical for winter wheat due to stronger effects of year and location on the phenotypic tolerance response. requiting about 95 yield comparisons to accurately define the crown rot phenotype of a winter wheat cultivar.},

Smiley et al. (22) concluded that damage from crown rot in the PNW is more widespread and damaging than previously recognized and that aboveground symptoms are not always apparent under conditions of moderate infection and yield constraint.

Percentages of whiteheads in the crop canopy are a more easily measured indicator of disease severity within experiments (20), but whitehead development is also strongly affected by environmental conditions (3,5,7,8,22) and may strongly underestimate crown rot incidence and the effect on yield (8,22).

Bockus et al. (2) described a method to calculate the number of experimental repetitions needed to achieve a given level of accuracy (margin of error) for assigning a phenotypic reaction of wheat cultivars to four foliar diseases. Applying a goal of defining the phenotypic response at the 95{\%} confidence interval, they determined that 20 to 47 observations (5 to 12 successful experiments with four replicates per treatment) were required, depending upon the specific disease, to define the phenotypic response of a wheat cultivar that exhibited an average amount of variability among repeated observations.

The objectives of this research were to evaluate the variability of F. pseudograminearum tolerance reactions among selected spring and winter wheat cultivars and breeding lines in eastern Oregon, and to estimate the number of experimental observations required to accurately define the phenotypic response for a typical cultivar or line.

M{\&}M
Yields were occasionally (
The number of observations (experiments × replicates) required to describe a phenotypic reaction at varying levels of statistical accuracy was determined using the margin-of-error analysis described by Bockus et al. (2)

The number of observations required to define a phenotypic reaction within a given range of accuracy compared to the “true” value was calculated (2) using the formula: (t$\alpha$/2,n-1)(s/√n) = MOE
Results
Data for the four winter wheat experiments were analyzed as 3-way randomized blocks using year, location, and wheat entry as factors. Main effects were significant for year (P 
A similar analysis was performed after excluding the two experiments in which crown rot caused extensive yield reductions during 2002, assuming that the disease pressure during that year had the potential for overwhelming any inherent differences in tolerance that may have existed under more typical levels of disease severity.

The analysis estimated that 24 comparisons, as in four experiments with six replicates per treatment, were required to achieve a level of precision at a margin of error of ±5{\%} (95{\%} confidence level) for spring wheat

Linear regression illustrated that the standard deviation among replicates for individual wheat entries increased as the percent yield reduction increased, as would be expected. However, it was also shown through quadratic regression analysis that the standard deviation tended to be higher
for entries that were affected at an intermediate level of yield reduction compared to either a comparatively low or high level of response.

The margin-of-error analysis described by Bockus et al. (2) indicated that it is possible to accurately characterize the tolerance characteristics of spring and winter wheat entries within an acceptable period of time, provided that experiments in the analysis do not include years in which disease severity is extraordinarily high. In the latter case, standard deviations became too great to allow accurate phenotypic distinctions among crown rot tolerance levels.

Disscussion
Nevertheless, the Australian standards performed against crown rot in the PNW as they have been characterized in Australia. The intolerant Puseas was significantly more affected by crown rot than the tolerant Australian standards 2-49, Gala, and Sunco. In our tests, Sunco was slightly less tolerant than 2-49 and Gala. The PNWadapted cultivars Jefferson and Tara 2002 were also comparatively tolerant, ranking between 2-49 and Sunco. The PNWadapted cultivars Otis and Eden were among the least tolerant cultivars, ranking similarly to Puseas.

The influence of drought on expression of crown rot symptoms and on yield suppression is well known (3,4,12,19). Smiley (18) also reported that crown rot incidence was negatively correlated more significantly and more frequently with temperature than with moisture parameters in Oregon. Temperature and moisture in the seedzone and root-zone are strongly affected by the date on which winter wheat is planted in low-rainfall regions of the PNW

It is now clear that complex influences of climatic and location factors cause considerable variability to occur among rankings of crown rot responses for individual winter wheat cultivars. 

Greater variability of crown rot tolerance responses occurred among winter wheat compared to spring wheat entries tested across years and locations. The reason for this effect of wheat growth habit is not clear. It is possible that it was an expression of interactions among the lengths of the growing periods for spring and winter wheat, seasonal and annual temperature and moisture variables (18),

Emphasis for future research with winter wheat should also be shifted from a definition of tolerance to introduction of resistance (9,29,30), which will presumably be more stable across years and climates in the PNW.

abstract = {The fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects rising levels of greenhouse gas and global temperature. The well-known dependence of plant diseases on weather has long been exploited for predicting epidemics and to time applications of control measures for tactical disease management. Fingerprints of inter-annual climatic variation on pathogens have recently been shown in literature linking pathogen abundance to atmospheric composition. Past reviews have dealt with impacts of changing atmospheric composition and climate on diseases, regional or country-wide assessments of climate change impacts and impacts on specific disease/pathogen or pathogen groups. All agree on paucity of knowledge prompting a need to generate new empirical data on host-pathogen biology under a changing climate. Focused on experimental research, the purpose of this review is to summarize published and unpublished studies on plant pathogens and diseases in free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) facilities and open top chambers and other current non-FACE research to offer a summary of future research needs and opportunities. Critical review of recent literature on the influence of elevated CO2 and O3 on agriculture and forestry species forms a major part of the treatise. Summaries of unpublished or ongoing experimental research on plant pathogens from FACE studies are included as a catalogue of work in this neglected area. The catalogue and knowledge gaps are intended as a resource for workers initiating research in this area as well as the general scientific community grappling with the design and scope of next generation of FACE facilities.},

Larvae (15 and 20-day old) pre-pupae and pupae (early-, mid- and late-) were examined and found resistant to phosphine. The highest resistances were present in early- and mid-pupae at levels much higher than those selected in the adults. Latent toxic effects were observed following treatment of all stages except 15-day larvae and were most pronounced with 20-day larvae. Respiration rates in a normal atmosphere were similar in the two strains on a body-weight basis and differed in terms of oxygen consumption per individual in accordance with the weight differences between the two strains. Normal respiration rates did not account for, or contribute towards, the observed tolerance differences between the two strains. The oxygen consumption of all examined stages of the resistant strain was reduced less by phosphine than that of the corresponding stages of the susceptible strain but the significance of this in terms of phosphine uptake is not known.},

abstract = {Effects of age, sex, presence or absence of food, mating status, quantity of food, and food deprivation on rate of and time of flight initiation of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), were determined. Flight initiation declined with increasing age in both presence and absence of food. However, flight initiation was lower when food was present in the flight chambers than in the absence of food. In the presence of food, both mated and virgin beetles were equally likely to disperse by flight. However, in the absence of food, mated beetles initiated flight more readily that virgin individuals. Flight initiation was greatest when little or no food was present. The presence of varying quantities of food inside the flight chambers impacted the number of progeny produced by females before flight, but not the timing of flight. Rate of flight initiation was higher for beetles deprived of food for short periods of time compared with flight initiation of beetles with food in the flight chamber. Flight initiation decreased with increasing time without food. There were no differences in flight tendencies between males and females in the experiments reported here. Our results suggest that T. castaneum uses flight as a mechanism to disperse to new environments during almost any part of their life span and that this type of dispersion does not fit with the model of the so-called true migratory species that involves an "oogenesis-flight syndrome.},

The four most important species identified were Bipolaris sorokiniana (24.0{\%} from roots; 33.7{\%} from stems), Fusarium pseudograminearum (14.9{\%} from roots; 27.8{\%} from stems), Rhizoctonia cerealis (1.7{\%} from roots; 4.4{\%} from stems), and Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (9.8{\%} from roots; 4.4{\%} from stems). We observed that the recovered species varied with the agronomic zone. Fusarium pseudograminearum was predominant in regions 1 and 3, whereas F. graminearum, F. acuminatum, and R. cerealis were predominant in regions 2 and 4. The incidence of F. pseudograminearum and R. cerealis was significantly different between regions 1 and 4, while no significant association was found in the distribution of the other species and the agronomic zones. A negative correlation between the frequency of occurrence of F. pseudograminearum and mean annual precipitation during 2013-2016 (r = -0.71; P {\textless} 0.01) in the North China Plain and a positive correlation between the mean annual precipitation during 2013-2016 and the frequency of occurrence of F. asiaticum (r = 0.74; P {\textless} 0.01) were observed.

In more than 93{\%} of the fields, from the root and crown tissues of wheat, two or more root and crown rot species were isolated. The coexistence of Fusarium spp. and B. sorokiniana in one field (65.4{\%}) or in individual plants (11.6{\%}) was more common than for the other species combinations. Moreover, this is the first report on the association between F. sinensis and root and crown rot of wheat.

In the case of the soybean rust invasion of the United States, a linked monitoring, prediction, and communication network saved U. S. soybean growers approximately {\$}200 M/yr. Modeling of future movement of the pathogen (Phakopsora pachyrhizi) was based on data about current disease locations from an extensive network of sentinel plots. We developed a dynamic network model for U. S. soybean rust epidemics, with counties as nodes and link weights a function of host hectarage and wind speed and direction. We used the network model to compare four strategies for selecting an optimal subset of sentinel plots, listed here in order of increasing performance: random selection, zonal selection (based on more heavily weighting regions nearer the south, where the pathogen overwinters), frequency-based selection (based on how frequently the county had been infected in the past), and frequency-based selection weighted by the node strength of the sentinel plot in the network model. When dynamic network properties such as node strength are characterized for invasive species, this information can be used to reduce the resources necessary to survey and predict invasion progress.},

Crop rotation treatments included the following crops: canola ( C), lupin ( L), medic ( M), medic-clover mixture (Mc) and wheat ( W). Rotation treatments (RT) and within-treatment crop sequences were: RT 1 = W-W-W-W, RT 2= C-W-W-W, W-C-W-W, W-W-C-W, RT 3= C-W-L-W, L-W-C-W, RT 4= W-L-C-W, L-C-W-W, RT 5=M-W-M-W, RT 6=McW- Mc-W and RT 7= M-C-M-W. Crop rotation significantly affected the incidence of F. pseudograminearum, crown rot incidence and severity, dry mass and grain yield. The incidence of F. pseudograminearum was significantly higher on wheat for the rotation treatment that included 3 years of wheat and 1 year of canola compared with the other treatments, and the highest severities and incidences of crown rot and the lowest yields were also recorded for this treatment and the monoculture wheat. The lowest incidences of the fungus, as well as crown rot incidences and severities, and the highest yields were recorded for the rotation treatment that alternated wheat with a medic-clover mixture and the treatment that included wheat after 3 years of rotation with broadleaf crops. Crop rotation should, therefore, be an important component of management strategies against crown rot of wheat.},

abstract = {Using PCR, we amplified and sequenced approximately 1,000 bp of the 5' end of the intergenic spacer (IGS) of the rDNA in 15 isolates of Fusarium oxysporum and one isolate of F. subglutinans. Isolates were selected to represent diversity in our collection based on differences in pathogenic race, vegetative compatibility group (VCG), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype, IGS haplotype, and DNA fingerprint. The objective of this research was to clarify the origin of virulence within F. oxysporum, the relationship between pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains, and the evolution of the different races of F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis. Bootstrapped parsimony analysis of the partial IGS sequence data identified a phylogenetic tree with highly significant branches. The two F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis VCGs, 0131 and 0134, were separated into distinct lineages. Race was not distinguished by significant IGS sequence differences within the pathogen VCGs. One exception was a race 1 isolate which was associated with VCG 0131 but, based on both mtDNA and IGS haplotype, had greater affinity with VCG 0134. Two IGS sequence types were found in this race 1 isolate, one suggesting an affiliation with VCG 0131 and the other similar to isolates in VCG 0134. This may have resulted from past somatic or sexual interactions between F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis, VCGs 0131 and 0134. Nonpathogens that were vegetatively compatible with the pathogen were not closely related to the pathogen based on IGS sequence data. Thus, nonpathogens and pathogens may share common alleles at vegetative compatibility loci by coincidence rather than because of recent clonal derivation from a common ancestor.},

However modern agriculture is dependent on phosphorus derived from phosphate rock, which is a non-renewable resource and current global reserves may be depleted in 50–100 years. While phosphorus demand is projected to increase, the expected global peak in phosphorus production is predicted to occur around 2030. The exact timing of peak phosphorus production might be disputed, however it is widely acknowledged within the fertilizer industry that the quality of remaining phosphate rock is decreasing and production costs are increasing. Yet future access to phosphorus receives little or no international attention. This paper puts forward the case for including long-term phosphorus scarcity on the priority agenda for global food security. Opportunities for recovering phosphorus and reducing demand are also addressed together with institutional challenges.},

The purpose of this work was to answer this question. Daily weather data for the period 19602006 were analysed for five locations covering the zones of potato growing on the east coast of Scotland (between 55.213 and 57.646 similar to N) to determine trends in temperature, rainfall and solar radiation. A physiologically based potato yield model was validated using data obtained from a long-term field trial in eastern Scotland and then employed to simulate crop development and potential yield at each of the five sites. Over the 47 similar to years, there were significant increases in annual air and 30 similar to cm soil temperatures (0.27 and 0.30 similar to K similar to decade-1, respectively), but no significant changes in annual precipitation or in the timing of the last frost in spring and the first frost of autumn. There was no evidence of any north to south gradient of warming. Simulated emergence and canopy closure became earlier at all five sites over the period with the advance being greater in the north (3.7 and 3.6 similar to days similar to decade-1, respectively) than the south (0.5 and 0.8 similar to days similar to decade-1, respectively). Potential yield increased with time, generally reflecting the increased duration of the green canopy, at average rates of 2.8 similar to t similar to ha-1 decade-1 for chitted seed (sprouted prior to planting) and 2.5 similar to t similar to ha-1 decade-1 for unchitted seed. The measured warming could contribute potential yield increases of up to 13.2 similar to t similar to ha-1 for chitted potato (range 7.119.3 similar to t similar to ha-1) and 11.5 similar to t similar to ha-1 for unchitted potato (range 7.115.5 similar to t similar to ha-1) equivalent to 3439{\%} of the increased potential yield over the period or 2326{\%} of the increase in actual measured yields.},

abstract = {A great deal of information is available in the literature on the effects of nutrition on disease development in plants and crops. However, much of this information is contradictory and although it is widely recognised that nutrition can influence disease in crops, limited progress has been made in the manipulation of crop nutrition to enhance disease control. Achieving this aim requires a sound understanding of the effects of fertilisation on nutrient levels and availability in crop tissues, and in turn, how the nutrient status of such tissues influences pathogen infection, colonisation and sporulation. Some of these details are known for a number of crop plants under controlled conditions, but very little of this type of information is available for crops under field conditions. This review focuses on nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, potassium and silicon, examines the availability of these nutrients in plant tissues to support pathogen growth and development, and reviews the effects of the different nutrients on disease development. The review also examines the potential for manipulating crop nutrition to enhance disease control in conventional and organic cropping systems.},

abstract = {Mungbean (Vigna radiata var. radiata) is a key legume crop grown predominantly in South and Southeast Asia. Biotic and abiotic stresses cause significant yield reduction in mungbean, and among these, fungal diseases are particularly important. Although disease management practices, including physical, chemical, and biological methods have been researched and described in the literature, few of these are available or have been used by growers. Here we review the economic impact, pathogen characterization, and sustainable management options for the soil-borne and foliar fungal diseases of mungbean as well as major challenges to manage these diseases. Potential use of all possible components of integrated management practices including host resistance, fungicides, biocontrol agents, natural plant products, and cultural practices etc. are discussed. Major diseases include powdery mildew, anthracnose, Cercospora leaf spot, Fusarium wilt, Rhizoctonia root rot and web blight, Macrophomina charcoal rot/dry root rot and blight. Review of the literature indicated an absence of resistance to Rhizoctonia root rot, little sources of resistance for dry root rot and anthracnose. Major resistant genes (R genes) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified for powdery mildew and Cercospora leaf spot, which may be potentially used in Marker assisted selection (MAS). has been used in resistance breeding for both of the latter. Although the mechanisms of induced systemic resistance (ISR) by biocontrol agents have been studied with Macrophomina blight, there is little information on the mechanisms and use of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in managing fungal diseases of mungbean. Several studies targeted exploiting biological control for soil-borne root rot diseases. Botanical products, such as plant extracts, are also found effective to manage root and foliar diseases. However, many of these studies were limited to laboratory and/or green house experiments. Thus, long-term field studies are required for further exploitation of biological methods and commercial applications.},

@article{Verrell2017,
abstract = {Crown rot (CR), caused by the fungus Fusarium pseudograminearum (Fp), is a constraint to wheat production in semi-arid regions globally with limited management options to control the disease. Fp is a stubble-borne pathogen hence inoculum becomes concentrated in the previous cereal rows in a no-till system. Two field experiments in northern New South Wales (NSW), Australia, were conducted to examine whether inter row sowing reduces the impact of CR. The first examined the effect of wheat stubble (standing stubble and slashed), row cleaners (moved sideways with row cleaners or undisturbed) and row placement (on or between rows) on the incidence and severity of Fp and yield of durum wheat [Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum (Desr.)] in a wheat–wheat sequence. The second examined row placement plus ground engaging tool (disc vs tine) imposed on Fp-moderately susceptible bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and Fp-very susceptible durum wheat varieties in a third consecutive wheat crop. In experiment 1; sowing between rows reduced incidence of Fp by 6{\%}, reduced whiteheads/m2 by 27{\%} and increased yield by 6{\%} compared with sowing on the row. Moving inoculum away from the sown row using row cleaners also reduced incidence of Fp (by 3.7{\%}) and whiteheads (by 13.6{\%}) but this did not express as an increase in yield. In experiment 2; sowing between rows led to a 12{\%} reduction in incidence of Fp compared with sowing on the row, but this did not translate into a significant yield advantage. Sowing with a tine increased plant establishment, tiller density and grain yield compared to sowing with a disc. Under high disease pressure, the Fp-moderately susceptible variety out-yielded the Fp-very susceptible variety by 20{\%}. Inter-row sowing provided a yield advantage when sowing a second consecutive wheat crop but it did not provide a yield advantage under a third cereal in sequence. Integrating the individual management tools (row placement, residue management, ground engaging tool, varietal choice) appear to be useful additions to integrated management to reduce the impact of CR in a no-till system.},

abstract = {Atmospheric CO2 enrichment may bring different effects on plant growth and evapotranspiration if plants are under N and water deficient conditions. In this study, spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was grown in pots at two atmospheric CO2 concentrations (ambient and elevated), two levels of soil moisture (well-watered and droughted to 45-60{\%} of field capacity) and five nitrogen (N) fertilization treatments (0, 112.5, 225.0, 337.5, 450.0 kg hm(-2)) in growth chambers. Leaf growth, leaf area, and tiller increment were largely a function of N application and water supply. Elevated CO2 increased 23-45{\%} in leaf area only with the N-added treatments 55 days after sowing. Elevated CO2 also reduced stomatal conductance more in droughted treatments (-51{\%}) than in well-watered treatments (-41{\%}), and more with zero N application (-60{\%}) than with the adequate N (-35 to 44{\%}). Evapotranspiration (ET) was also reduced by CO, enrichment in a similar way. Our results showed that the CO2-enrichment-induced decrease in transpiration almost compensated for the increase in ET brought by the higher leaf area under adequate N and water Supply, such that ET was similar for control and CO2-enriched plants. Under reduced N and water supply, CO2 enrichment had limited effect on either leaf growth or ET. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This review discusses the present trends in studies on the impacts of climate change on plant diseases. Firstly, the approaches used for studying the potential effects of altered temperature, water availability, CO2 and O-3 air concentrations, and UV-B radiation on components of the disease cycle are explained and discussed. Next, the impact of changes in climate patterns on the geographic and temporal distribution of diseases by integrating biological and epidemiological models into geographic and climate databases are assessed. Finally, adaptation strategies are discussed and areas where there is a recognized lack of knowledge are highlighted. The literature shows that different pathosystems respond in different ways to climate change. Thus, case-by-case studies on the responses of crop species or varieties and their diseases to climate change are necessary. In addition to that, wide-scale projections of disease risk are necessary in order to identify research priorities, whereas industry must be strategically directed and public policies developed to establish adaptation measures and to prevent potential food security crisis. Only by conducting long-term and multidisciplinary studies can we reduce the uncertainty regarding the effects of climate change on plant diseases.},

annote = {My interpretation of the data
14 days after sowing, Resistant and Susceptible seedlings (2-49 and Purseas) were inoculated with F.pseudograminearum on the coleoptile.

at 14 dai, In the resistant variety there was greater symptom and colonisation through the sub coronal internode and upper leaf sheaths; In the susceptible there was greater colonisation through the basal leaf sheaths.

There was symptom and colonisation of the leaf blades, however this was insignificant compared to stem infection.

Authors interpretation of data
Lesion edges on the leaf blade typically had slim chlorotic margins. While visual discolouration could affect 100 {\%} of the tissue of a leaf sheath, visual assessments frequently indicated a cessation of symptom development at the ligule of that leaf (Fig. 1b).

Leaf senecence was not a predictable feature of infection.

Due to the lack of uniformity of symptoms, colonisation and tissues of primary roots, secondary roots and sub-crown internodes the correlations between visual symptoms and fungal biomass have only been reported for leaf tissues (Fig. 5). CONSISTANT WITH FINDINGS BY MELLOY, OBANOR AND CHAKRABORTY

In addition, the observation of green and apparently healthy leaf blades attached to entirely discoloured leaf sheaths supports the observations of Knight and Sutherland (2013), which indicate that vascular tissues of seedling leaf sheaths are not colonised by F. pseudograminearum and thus may still be supplying the leaf blade with water and mineral nutrients. THIS MIGHT BE CONTRARY TO OBSERVATIONS IN THE SPAD DATA

abstract = {This study examined the relationship between the senescence induced by water deficits and carbon remobilization during grain filling. Two wheat cultivars ( Triticum aestivum L.), Marvdasht and Zagros (sensitive and tolerant to terminal season drought, respectively) grown at a day: night temperature of 22:15degreesC from anthesis were held as well watered controls (Field capacity), or subject to water deficit (50{\%} FC) imposed either from anthesis to 14 days later (WS1) or from 14 days after anthesis to maturity (WS2). Relative water content, photosynthetic activity, chlorophyll content, soluble proteins of flag leaves, level of soluble sugars, in the peduncle (enclosed by the flag leaf sheath) and the penultimate internodes and grain yield were assessed. Results showed that water deficits enhanced the senescence by accelerating loss of leaf chlorophyll and soluble proteins and the loss was more under WS2 than WS1. The net CO 2 assimilation rate (P N) in flag leaves during water deficit display a strict correlation with the drought sensitivity of the genotypes and showed an early reduction in Marvdasht. Water stress, both at WS1 and WS2, facilitated the reduction in concentration of total soluble sugars in the internodes, promoted the re-allocation of pre-stored carbohydrate from the peduncle and penultimate to grains. WS2 resulted in more deleterious effect on grain yield than WS1 in both cultivars and led to a smaller kernels and lesser aerial biomass at maturity. The loss was more in Marvdasht than Zagros. Our results suggest that the senescence and remobilization promoted by water deficits during grain filling are coupled processes in wheat, and mass of soluble sugars in the stems is premier than sugar remobilization efficiency. Varietal differences in the extent of such trait existed. It would be advantageous to select genotypes with greater capacity to do this under water deficit conditions.},

abstract = {Use of foliar fungicides on corn has increased over the last decade. Part of the reason for this increase is due to physiological benefits on plants from QoI (strobilurin) containing fungicides. However, there remains controversy over how significant yield and economic benefits are from strobilurin fungicides. A potential source of this controversy might be explained by experimental plot size. To better understand grower-relevant yield benefits from fungicides, three hundred and fourteen commercial-strip trials (8.1 ha fungicide treated and 8.1 ha untreated) were conducted on growers' farms across four years, and twenty-five small plot (37.2 m2 or less) trials were conducted across the corn belt in 2010. Yield benefits from fungicides were much greater in the commercial-strip trials than in the small plot trials. In 2011, twenty-six large plot trials (ranging from 557 to 1394 m2), were established with efforts made to reduce border and alley effects. Two corn hybrids were evaluated at each of the 26 trial locations, and the results indicated that corn yield benefits from Quadris{\textregistered} fungicide (a solo formulation containing 22.9{\%} azoxystrobin) applied at the V4-V8 growth stage, Quilt Xcel{\textregistered} fungicide (a premix formulation containing 13.5{\%} azoxystrobin and 11.7{\%} propiconazole) applied at the R1 growth stage, or a combination of the two, provided yield benefits similar to those from the commercial-strip trials. The financial gain/loss from the use of fungicides was determined. Using the highest cost estimates for fungicide and applications, Quilt Xcel fungicide applied at the R1 growth stage provided estimated yield benefits of {\$}105, {\$}219, {\$}241, and {\$}278/ha ({\$}19, {\$}65, {\$}74, and {\$}89/A) over the untreated checks in the commercial-strip trials conducted in 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013, respectively. The average economic benefit to growers over the four year period was {\$}211 ± 37/ha ({\$}62 ± {\$}15/A). Variability in economic benefit not only includes costs associated with fungicides but also includes annual commodity price, disease pressure, and location effects. This study supports the hypothesis that plot size influences assessment of yield effects of fungicides. Yield responses from the small plot, large plot, and commercial-strip trials resulted in increases of 378 kg/Ha (6 Bu/A), 701 kg/Ha (11 Bu/A), and 1132 kg/Ha (18 Bu/A) over the untreated, respectively.},

abstract = {Panama disease of banana, caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, is a serious con-straint both to the commercial production of banana and cultivation for subsistence agriculture. Previous work has indicated that F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense consists of several clonal lineages that may be genetically distant. In this study we tested whether lineages of the Panama disease pathogen have a monophyletic origin by comparing DNA sequences of nuclear and mitochondrial genes. DNA sequences were ob-tained for translation elongation factor 1␣ and the mitochon-drial small subunit ribosomal RNA genes for F. oxysporum strains from banana, pathogenic strains from other hosts and putatively nonpathogenic isolates of F. oxysporum. Cla-dograms for the two genes were highly concordant and a partition-homogeneity test indicated the two datasets could be combined. The tree inferred from the combined dataset resolved five lineages corresponding to ''F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense'' with a large dichotomy between two taxa represented by strains most commonly isolated from bananas with Pan-ama disease. The results also demonstrate that the latter two taxa have significantly different chromosome numbers. F. oxysporum isolates collected as nonpathogenic or pathogenic to other hosts that have very similar or identical elongation factor 1␣ and mitochondrial small subunit genotypes as banana pathogens were shown to cause little or no disease on banana. Taken together, these results indicate Panama dis-ease of banana is caused by fungi with independent evolu-tionary origins.},

Pathogen populations with a high evolutionary potential are more likely to overcome genetic resistance than pathogen populations with a low evolutionary potential. We propose a flexible framework to predict the evolutionary potential of pathogen populations based on analysis of their genetic structure. According to this framework, pathogens that pose the greatest risk of breaking down resistance genes have a mixed reproduction system, a high potential for genotype flow, large effective population sizes, and high mutation rates. The lowest risk pathogens are those with strict asexual reproduction, low potential for gene flow, small effective population sizes, and low mutation rates. We present examples of high-risk and low-risk pathogens. We propose general guidelines for a rational approach to breed durable resistance according to the evolutionary potential of the pathogen.},

Vuill. sensu lato and the aggregation pheromone sordidin (Cosmolure((R))) was tested against the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). The viability of B.bassiana conidia, blended with hydrogenated oil and exposed for up to 150min to heating at 50 degrees C, was not affected and the aggregation pheromone did not undergo any decomposition. Conidial viability in pellets decreased by 50{\%} after an average of 15.1 and 9.1days at 25 and 40 degrees C, respectively, when packaged in polypropylene bags. Active packaging (hermetic bag+O-2/moisture-absorbing sachet) increased the shelf lives almost 10 and 6 times at 25 and 40 degrees C, respectively. In olfactometer bioassays, fat pellets amended with pheromone (sordidin, 1{\%} wt/vol) were highly attractive to C.sordidus adults for up to 15days, after which the pheromone release rate had decreased by about 90{\%} and pellets were no longer attractive. Pellets with pheromone and conidia were as attractive to C.sordidus as banana rhizomes, and considerably more attractive than pieces of pseudostem. In no-choice experiments conducted in boxes, survival of insects exposed to fungus-impregnated pellets was affected by fat type (soybean fat vs. palm stearin) and bioassay temperature (25 vs. 30 degrees C), with results favoring soybean fat pellets at the higher temperature (96.9{\%} of mortality after 18days and ST50 of 7.7days). However, mortality levels were low (21.7{\%} for soybean fat pellets) or very low (1-5{\%} for palm stearin pellets) in choice experiments carried out at 25 degrees C when fungus-impregnated pellets were applied before or after exposure of pseudostem residues to insects, respectively. The potential of this delivery system to manage C.sordidus populations and other insect pests (including those with cryptic habits) is discussed.},

Our understanding of some fundamental aspects of DBM biology and ecology, particularly host plant relationships, tritrophic interactions, and migration, has improved con-siderably but knowledge of other aspects, e.g., its global distribution and rel-ative abundance, remains surprisingly limited. Biological control still focuses almost exclusively on a few species of hymenopteran parasitoids. Although these can be remarkably effective, insecticides continue to form the basis of management; their inappropriate use disrupts parasitoids and has resulted in field resistance to all available products. Improved ecological understand-ing and the availability of a series of highly effective selective insecticides throughout the 1990s provided the basis for sustainable and economically viable integrated pest management (IPM) approaches. However, repeated reversion to scheduled insecticide applications has resulted in resistance to these and more recently introduced compounds and the breakdown of IPM programs. Proven technologies for the sustainable management of DBM currently exist, but overcoming the barriers to their sustained adoption re-mains an enormous challenge.},

abstract = {Strobilurins have been commercially used since 1996 for the control of Erysiphe graminis on cereals in Europe. Sensitivity monitoring of airborne and field samples of the pathogen detected only sensitive populations from 1996 to 1997, but in 1998 resistant wheat isolates (resistance factors of EC50s {\textgreater} 500) were found in airborne samples from three different regions in North Germany. These isolates already occurred at up to 90{\%} frequencies suggesting that resistant individuals may have high levels of fitness, and that they could have previously escaped detection with conventional methods which measure EC50s of bulk samples or which sample limited numbers of single-colony isolates per region. An alternative method measuring frequencies of resistant colonies in bulk samples at a discriminatory dose of 3 ppm trifloxystrobin relative to that at 0 ppm, showed that resistance to stobilurins can occur at frequencies which do not affect the mean EC50s of these samples. In 1999, high levels of resistance were still concentrated in parts of Germany but became detectable in other regions of the country, and in other countries including France, Belgium, UK and Denmark. Losses in performance were detected in areas with high frequencies of resistance. In a competition experiment between resistant and sensitive isolates over three generations, resistance was stable in the absence of selection; the resistant isolate appeared equal in fitness to the sensitive isolate on untreated plant material; and was rapidly selected for on strobilurin-treated material. Selection studies on bulk isolates confirmed this finding but also indicated the existence of a range of fitness levels. There were high levels of cross-resistance between strobilurins but not with demethylation inhibitors, morpholines, anilinopyrimidines and quinoxyfen. This assessment of resistance risk suggests that use recommendations of strobilurins for wheat powdery mildew control must include elements for strict resistance management. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Global change encompasses changes in atmospheric composition, climate and climate variability, and land cover and land use. The occurrence of these changes and their interactive effects on biological systems are worldwide; thus, an effective global change research and impact assessment program must be based on international and interdisciplinary research and communication. With this in mind, several collaborative research networks with a focus on global change have been established in the biological sciences. They include the Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems (GCTE) Core Project of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) which aims to predict the effects of global change on terrestrial ecosystems, including agriculture and production forestry. Because of the importance of plant pests (arthropods, microbial pathogens, weeds) as yield-reducing factors in agriculture and as early indicators of global change, GCTE initiated a network Activity on "Global Change Impacts on Pests, Diseases and Weeds" with the overall goal of developing a predictive capability for impact assessment and adaptation. The network's specific objectives, contributing research projects, initial results and future challenges are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This review assesses the impacts, both direct and indirect, of man-made changes to the composition of the air over a 200 year period on the severity of arable crop disease epidemics. The review focuses on two well-studied UK arable crops, wheat and oilseed rape, relating these examples to worldwide food security. In wheat, impacts of changes in concentrations of SO2 in air on two septoria diseases are discussed using data obtained from historical crop samples and unpublished experimental work. Changes in SO2 seem to alter septoria disease spectra both through direct effects on infection processes and through indirect effects on soil S status. Work on the oilseed rape diseases phoma stem canker and light leaf spot illustrates indirect impacts of increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, mediated through climate change. It is projected that, by the 2050s, if diseases are not controlled, climate change will increase yields in Scotland but halve yields in southern England. These projections are discussed in relation to strategies for adaptation to environmental change. Since many strategies take 10–15 years to implement, it is important to take appropriate decisions soon. Furthermore, it is essential to make appropriate investment in collation of long-term data, modelling and experimental work to guide such decision-making by industry and government, as a contribution to worldwide food security.},
annote = {Currently, more than 1 billion people (one-sixth of world population) do not on average have enough to eat (FAO, 2009). In normal circumstances and most parts of the world, this has little to do with losses to pests and diseases and much to do with access to input resources and power within society (Sen, 1999).

Some estimates for four of the largest crops put actual worldwide losses to diseases, despite use of crop protection strategies, as high as 55 kg per person per season (Table 1, assuming a world population of 6{\AE}5 billion)

Regardless of the problems of financial measurement, the food security problems associated with crop diseases are especially severe in the developing world, where even local destruction of crops can lead to starvation for farming families (Strange {\&} Scott, 2005; Forbes {\&} Simon, 2007).

The aim of this review is to examine how environmental change associated with both direct and indirect impacts of human-caused changes in air composition may impact on severity of crop disease epidemics. Two UK arable crops are used as examples, because they are well studied; nonetheless, general conclusions can be tentatively drawn from these local examples.

However, high SO2 3 concentrations in the water in which spores were suspended for artificial inoculation favoured infection of wheat leaves by spores of P. nodorum more than they favoured infection by spores of M. graminicola. Furthermore, glasshouse experiments in which wheat grown with different nutrient solution treatments was inoculated with the pathogens suggest that, although low sulphate concentration in soil favours both pathogens, it benefits M. graminicola much more. Given that the two pathogens must compete for resources, since they both infect the same leaves under similar environmental conditions (Shaw et al., 2008), relatively moderate changes in host susceptibility mediated by changes in airborne S input to the soil could change the balance between the two pathogens

Chandramohan (2010), these results do suggest a mechanism by which SO2 concentrations in the air could influence the range of diseases affecting a crop, and the historical data suggest that they have done so.

Such impacts can include changes in the predominant disease present on a crop (Bearchell et al., 2005; Shaw et al., 2008), changes in the range or severity of epidemics (Evans et al., 2008) or introduction of new diseases to a region (Shaw {\&} Osborne, 2011). However, long-term data sets are needed to test the models used for projection, with both disease ⁄ pathogen data and gaseous composition ⁄ weather data (Jeger{\&}Pautasso, 2008).

Projections in which values of explanatory variables (e.g. temperature, rainfall) remain within the range of those observed when collecting the experimental data must be more secure than those projections which extrapolate beyond this range; hence Evans et al. (2008) projected forward to the 2020s and 2050s, but not the 2080s, which would have taken relationships within the model outside the range of observed data.

It is particularly important to assess threats to food production in areas of the world most threatened by environmental change where there are already serious shortages of food, such as sub- Saharan Africa (Strange {\&} Scott, 2005; Schmidhuber {\&} Tubiello, 2007) but, in general, data are least available and experiments hardest to do in the poorest communities.

The efforts that have been made are hindered by the relatively complex epidemiology of many pathogens and great sensitivity of final disease severity to small environmental changes. Furthermore, the relationships in most weatherbased models developed for use in disease forecasting are often not adequate for projection of the disease into future climates (Bourgeois et al., 2004; Shaw, 2009)

Another action assisting adaptation to the altered environment may be to sow seed of cultivars that are more resistant against the pathogens favoured by the changed environment. The effectiveness of this resistance can be expected to improve if disease epidemics gradually become more severe, since disease resistance will then have a greater weighting in the selection criteria used by individual breeders and national testing procedures, such as the UK HGCA Recommended Lists

However, that is no reason not to make projections (Stern, 2007), provided that any assumptions made are clearly stated (Evans et al., 2010), since they provide the best available basis for discussion of current decision making.

It is particularly important to assess threats to food production in areas of the world most threatened by environmental change where there are already serious shortages of food, such as sub- Saharan Africa (Strange {\&} Scott, 2005; Schmidhuber {\&} Tubiello, 2007)},

The experiment was executed in the split-plot design comprising the combination of the five levels of irrigation arranged as a main plot and the four rates of N application distributed to a sub-plot. The five irrigation treatments were: I-o-no irrigation after the establishment of seedlings; I-1,-one irrigation at 23 days after sowing (DAS) of wheat seeds; I-2-two irrigations: one at 23 DAS and the other at 60 DAS; I-3-two irrigations: one at 23 DAS and the other at 80 DAS; l,three irrigations: at 23, 60 and 80 DAS. The four rates of N application were: N,no application of N fertilizer; N,, N.. and N,application of N at the rates of 80, 120 and 160 kg ha (1), respectively. Both irrigation and N application have created a significant impact on leaf photosynthesis (LPn), leaf area index (LAI), crop growth rate (CGR) and biomass production of wheat. Irrigation scheduling which included irrigation at the grain filling stage (80 DAS) coupled with N application up to 120 kg ha(-1) significantly increased LPn, LAI, CGR and biomass production. With respect to the growth stage, LPn and CGR were highest at the anthesis stage (70-75DAS) and LAI was maximum at the booting stage (60DAS). Increased dry matter accumulation at maturation was mainly due to the increased weight of grains.},

abstract = {A PCR assay based on a pair of oligonucleotide primers targeting the 16S and 23S rRNA genes was used to detect Fusarium oxy- sporum f. sp. vasinfectum (Fov), a fungus causing Fusarium wilt of cotton, in infected cotton seedlings. By using the primer pair Fov1-Eg-f and Fov1-Eg-r, a 438-bp DNA fragment was consistent- ly amplified from 41 Egyptian isolates of Fov (race 3), while no amplification was obtained from template genomic DNAs ob- tained from other fungal pathogens, namely F. oxysporum, F. solani, F. verticillioides, F. sambucinum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Macrophomina phaseolina. PCR product of the expected size was amplified from as little as 100 fg of purified Fov genomic DNA. The sensitivity of real-time PCR allowed detection of 200 fg of target genomic DNA. The melting temperature (Tm) values of Fov isolates were in the range 86.83 to 87.02. Fov DNA was de- tected in infected cotton roots, while no amplification was ob- tained from other plant structures, such as stem and leaf. The re- al-time PCR assay successfully detected Fov and correlated well with assessments based on conventional PCR techniques. The application of this technique will be useful for identification of Fov in infected cotton roots and detection of Fov in infected plants that lack visible morphological structures or symptoms.},

abstract = {The effect of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration oil rice blast and sheath blight disease severity was Studied in the Field in northern Japan for 3 years. With free-air CO2 enrichnient (FACE), rice plants were grown in ambient and elevated (approximate to 200 to 280 mu mol mol(-1) above ambient) CO2 concentrations, and were artificially inoculated with consist of Magnaporthe oryzae. Rice plants grown in an elevated CO2 concentration were more susceptible to leaf blast than those in ambient CO2 as, indicated by the increased number of leaf blast lesions. Plains grown Under elevated CO2 concentration had lower leaf silicon content, which may have contributed to the increased Susceptibility to leaf blast under elevated CO2 concentrations. In contrast to leaf blast, panicle blast severity wits unchanged by the CO2 enrichment under artificial inoculation, whereas it was slightly but significantly higher under elevated CO2 concentrations in a spontaneous rice blast epidemic. For naturally Occurring epidemics of the sheath blight development in rice plants, the percentage of diseased plants was higher under elevated as opposed to ambient CO2 concentrations. However, the average height of lesions above the soil Surface was similar between the treatments. One hypothesis is that the higher number of filters observed under elevated CO2 concentrations may have increased the Chance for fungal sclerotia to adhere to the leaf sheath at the water surface. Consequently, the potential risks for infection of leaf blast Would increase in rice grown under and epidemics of sheath blight elevated CO2 concentration.},

Wheat canopy microclimate observations were conducted from 19 March to 24 May 2007 at elongation to maturity stage. The results show that daytime total canopy sensible heat flux of FACE is higher than the ambient sensible heat flux, while a lower latent heat flux of FACE is observed throughout the observation period. The maximum difference in wheat canopy sensible and latent heat flux between FACE and the ambient varies by 12-78 and -12- 63 W/m2 respectively. Canopy stomatal conductance from P-M calculation agrees well with measured leaf stomatal conductance of wheat, indicating that microclimate data, latent and sensible heat flux estimated from residual energy balance are accurate. Total water-use by wheat throughout the observation period is 25.5 mm less under FACE than that under control condition. Reduced transpiration combined with increased total biomass results in a 19{\%} increase in water use efficiency of wheat in FACE.},

abstract = {The relationship between resistance to Septoria tritici blotch with plant height and heading date has been in most cases attributed to genetic associations. More efficient selection for higher levels of quantitative resistance may result if the nature of the association between susceptibility with earliness and shortness can be determined. Genetic resistance to Septoria tritici blotch and its relationships with plant height and heading date were recorded in 50 Argentinean wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars in three environments (two in the field and one in the greenhouse) with one virulent isolate of Mycosphaerella graminicola (Fuckel) Schroeter, in Cohn (anamorph Septoria tritici Rob. ex Desm.). Furthermore, a set of 16 cultivars was tested with seven isolates of M. graminicola in the greenhouse at the adult stage. Cultivars varied greatly in resistance to the disease and plant material was identified with moderate to high levels of resistance to several isolates. The field and greenhouse experiments demonstrated no evidence of genetic associations between plant height, heading date, and resistance, indicating that selection of early and short lines with high levels of quantitative resistance is possible. The relationships between those traits were mainly caused by environmental and epidemiological factors, which indicates that management of cultivars should be optimized to minimize these associations.},

@article{Gilbert2013a,
abstract = {This article reviews the recent progress of research on fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat. It addresses the broad areas of strategies for disease management, biological control, the pathogen (Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae)), mycotoxins, the effects of dwarfing genes on FHB severity, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and new perspectives. Where there are recent reviews on this subject, we have deliberately examined the subsequent literature to provide an update on research. With few resistant cultivars available even now, the main tools to manage the disease remain rotation, varietal selection, disease forecasting and fungicides. A few biocontrol organisms are being considered for commercial application. The pathogen's sexual life cycle has been investigated in depth, and with its complete genome sequence known, the pathways and genes controlling the sexual development and ascospore release of F. graminearum are being explored. The 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol chemotype of F. graminearum has increased in prevalence in Canada with attendant risks of higher DON levels in cereal grain. Stringent limits on allowable levels of Fusarium mycotoxins in the food/feed chain have been enacted in Europe and the USA, but regulations for Canada are only at the discussion stage with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Efforts to develop FHB-resistant lines proceed apace, as these can be selected in most wheat populations despite the adverse effects of dwarfing genes on FHB severity. While more quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for disease resistance continue to be identified and mapped, new resistant cultivars remain disappointingly few. We present some encouraging early results from an alternative approach based on epigenetics.},

abstract = {The distributions of Fusarium graminearum (Gibberella zeae), F. pseudograminearum (F. graminearum Group 1) and F. culmorum from cereals in Australia were determined from published survey data and accessions to culture collections. The distributions were analysed in terms of climate, using the climate matching system BIOCLIM. F. graminearum was found mostly in warm temperate to subtropical areas with moderate to high summer rainfall, where mean temperature of the warmest quarter was greater than 18.7degreesC and rainfall of the warmest quarter was greater than 195 mm. This appeared to be due to the effect of climate on production of maize, the host from which most records were obtained. F. pseudograminearum occurred throughout the main cereal growing areas and its occurrence did not appear to be limited by climate within the Australian grain belt. The distribution of F. culmorum on cereals was more limited than that of F. pseudograminearum. In the southern winter rainfall zone, F. culmorum was restricted to sites with mean summer temperatures less than about 22degreesC and annual rainfall greater than about 350 mm, whereas in the northern summer rainfall zone F. culmorum was restricted to areas with mean summer temperatures less than about 24.5degreesC and annual rainfall greater than about 625 mm.},

abstract = {Agricultural development in sub-Saharan Africa faces daunting challenges, which climate change and increasing climate variability will compound in vulnerable areas. The impacts of a changing climate on agricultural production in a world that warms by 4°C or more are likely to be severe in places. The livelihoods of many croppers and livestock keepers in Africa are associated with diversity of options. The changes in crop and livestock production that are likely to result in a 4°C+ world will diminish the options available to most smallholders. In such a world, current crop and livestock varieties and agricultural practices will often be inadequate, and food security will be more difficult to achieve because of commodity price increases and local production shortfalls. While adaptation strategies exist, considerable institutional and policy support will be needed to implement them successfully on the scale required. Even in the 2°C+ world that appears inevitable, planning for and implementing successful adaptation strategies are critical if agricultural growth in the region is to occur, food security be achieved and household livelihoods be enhanced. As part of this effort, better understanding of the critical thresholds in global and African food systems requires urgent research.},

Due to the differences of genetic backgrounds and analysis methods, the linked marker and signifi cance levels of QTL are not consistent across studies. Such discrepancies make it diffi cult to select diagnostic fl anking markers. Meta-analysis has been used to estimate the confi dence intervals (CIs) of QTL in plant and animal genomes. The objective of this study was to cluster 249 FHB resistance QTL identifi ed in 46 unique lines from 45 studies based on the estimated QTL CI by meta-analysis. A total of 209 QTL conditioning FHB resistance type I, II, III and IV were classifi ed into 43 clusters on 21 chromosomes. Among them, 119 QTL were signifi cant and 116 QTL explained more than 10{\%} of phenotypic variation. There are 19 confi rmed QTL located on chromosomes 3A, 5A, 7A, 1B, 3BS, 5B, 6B, and 2D. The results provide chromosome locations and linked markers for overlapping and unique QTL. Markers fl anking QTL clusters can be used to pyramid diverse QTL more effi ciently through marker-assisted breeding. {\textcopyright} Crop Science Society of America.},

Growing resistant varieties has long been recognised as an integral part in effectively managing the disease. One of the factors hindering the progress of breeding for crown rot resistance is the lack of a reliable and high throughput bioassay that allows rapid and accurate assessment of large numbers of genotypes so that highly susceptible materials can be quickly rejected and potentially resistant lines identified for more focused further assessments. We developed a method which, by growing several inoculated seedlings wrapped in a single piece of moist paper towel, offers significant advantages over all of the existing methods. The new soil-less assay takes only about two weeks, requires very little space, and removes variability associated with the use of soil/potting mixes. Results from the new assay are highly reproducible and agree well with known field performances of different varieties. However, mapping studies conducted using the new soil-less assay did not detect all of the quantitative trait loci found with a soil-based assay. These results show that, although different resistance genes may all contribute to the performance of a variety, caution should be used when comparing results from different assays.},

abstract = {The disease crown rot, caused predominantly by the fungal pathogen Fusarium pseudograminearum, is a major disease of winter cereals in many regions of the world, including Australia. A methodology is proposed, using response curves, to robustly estimate the relationship between grain yield and increasing crown rot pathogen burdens. Using data from a field experiment conducted in northern New South Wales, Australia in 2016, response curves were derived for five commercial wheat cultivars exposed to six increasing rates of crown rot inoculum, where the rates served to establish a range of crown rot pathogen burdens. In this way, the response curve methodology is fundamentally different from alternate approaches that rely on genetic or environmental variation to establish a range in pathogen burdens over which yield loss relationships are estimated. By manipulating only the rates of crown rot inoculum and, thus, pathogen burden directly, the number of additional confounding factors and interactions are minimized, enabling the robust estimation of the rate of change in yield due to increasing crown rot pathogen burdens for each cultivar. The methodology revealed variation in the rate of change in yield between cultivars, along with the extent of crown rot symptoms expressed by the cultivars. Variation in the rate of change in yield between cultivars provides definitive evidence of differences in the tolerance of commercial Australian wheat cultivars to crown rot caused by F. pseudograminearum, while variation in the extent of crown rot symptoms signifies differences in the resistance of the cultivars to this disease. The response curve methodology also revealed variation in how the different mechanisms of tolerance and resistance act to limit yield losses due to crown rot for different cultivars.},

A recent subjective survey of Australian wheat pathologists
by Murray and Brennan (2009) reported current annual yield
losses of 1.9{\%} in wheat due to crown rot caused by
F. pseudograminearum and F. culmorum in south-eastern
Australia. Our survey suggests that current losses due to crown
rot may be slightly more with losses of 2–3{\%} attributable to white
heads and further losses due to the effects of crown rot on grain

abstract = {Powdery mildew (PM) is a common and serious disease of mungbean [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek]. A few quantitative trait loci (QTL) for PM resistance in mungbean have been reported. The objective of this study was to locate QTL for PM resistance in two resistant accessions V4718 and RUM5. Simple sequence repeat markers were analyzed in an F2 population from a cross between Kamphaeng Saen 1 (KPS1; susceptible to PM) and V4718 (resistant to PM), and in F2 and BC1F1 populations from a cross between Chai Nat 60 (CN60; susceptible to PM) and RUM5 (resistant to PM). Progenies of 134 F2:3 and F2:4 lines derived from KPS1 × V4718, and 190 F2:3 and 74 BC1F1:2 lines derived from CN60 × RUM5 and CN60 × (CN60 × RUM5), respectively, were evaluated for response to PM under field conditions. Multiple interval mapping identified a major QTL on linkage group (LG) 9 and two minor QTL on LG4 for the resistance in V4718, and detected two major QTL on LG6 and LG9 and one minor QTL on LG4 for the resistance in RUM5. Comparative linkage analysis of the QTL for PM resistance in this study and in previous reports suggests that the resistance QTL on LG9 in V4718, RUM5, ATF3640 and VC6468-11-1A are the same locus or linked. One QTL on LG4 is the same in three sources (V4718, RUM5 and VC1210A). Another QTL on LG6 is the same in two sources (RUM5 and VC6468-11-1A). In addition, one QTL in V4718 on LG4 appears to be a new resistance locus. These different resistance loci will be useful for breeding durably PM-resistant mungbean cultivars. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Phenological development, leaf emergence, tillering and leaf area index (LAI), and duration (LAD) of spring wheat cv. Minaret, grown in open-top chambers at different sites throughout Europe for up to 3 years at each site, were investigated in response to elevated CO2 (ambient CO2 x2) and ozone (ambient ozone x1.5) concentrations. Phenological development varied among experiments and was partly explained by differences in temperature among sites and years. There was a weak positive relationship between the thermal rate of development and the mean daylength for the period from emergence to anthesis. Main stems produced on average 7.7 leaves with little variation among experiments. Variation was higher for the thermal rate of leaf emergence, which was partly explained by differences in the rate of change of daylength at plant emergence among seasons. Phenological development, rate of leaf emergence and final leaf number were not affected by CO2 and ozone exposure. Responses of tillering and LAI to CO2 and ozone exposure were significant only in some experiments. However, the direction of responses was consistent for most experiments. The number of tillers and ears per plant, respectively, was increased as a result of CO2 enrichment by about 13{\%} at the beginning of stem elongation (DC31), at anthesis and at maturity. Exposure to ozone had no effect on tillering. LAI was increased as a result of CO2 elevation by about 11{\%} at DC31 and by about 14{\%} at anthesis. Ozone exposure reduced LAI at anthesis by about 9{\%}. No such effect was observed at DC31. There were very few interactive effects of CO2 and ozone on tillering and LAI. Variations in tillering and LAI, and their responses to CO2 and ozone exposure, were partly explained by single linear relationships considering differences in plant density, tiller density and the duration of developmental phases among experiments. Consideration of temperature and incident photosynthetically active radiation in this analysis did not reduce the unexplained variation. There was a negative effect of ozone exposure on leaf area duration at most sites. Direct effects of elevated CO2 concentration on leaf senescence, both positive and negative, were observed in some experiments. There was evidence in several experiments that elevated CO2 concentration ameliorated the negative effect of ozone on leaf area duration. It was concluded from these results that an analysis of the interactive effects of climate, CO2 and ozone on canopy development requires reference to the physiological processes involved.

Entomopathogenic fungi, specifically the anamorphic taxa Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae, Hypocreales (Ascomycota), are among the natural enemies of pests in agroecosystems and the fungi are candidates for future conservation biological control in temperate regions. Conservation biological control is a biological control strategy in which farming practices and environmental manipulations are adopted to enhance the living conditions for specific natural enemies of pests. However, in order to manipulate the environment for the benefit of populations of the entomopathogens, knowledge of fundamental aspects of the ecology of the fungi considered is necessary. This knowledge is still scarce despite the large bulk of recent research into inoculation and inundation biological control with these fungi. Here, we review the current knowledge of the ecology of indigenous populations of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae in agroecosystems of temperate regions, primarily Europe and North America. We suggest anamorphic life cycles of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae in these regions based on the literature of their natural occurrence and distribution in agroecosystems, population dynamics, and interactions with other organisms, environmental factors, and agronomical practices.},

Phytopathology 102:331-343. Verticillium dahliae is responsible for Verticillium wilt on a wide range of hosts, including strawberry, on which low soil inoculum densities can cause significant crop loss. Determination of inoculum density is currently done by soil plating but this can take 6 to 8 weeks to complete and delay the grower's ability to make planting decisions. To provide a faster means for estimating pathogen populations in the soil, a multiplexed TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay based on the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) intergenic spacer (IGS) was devel-oped for V. dahliae. The assay was specific for V. dahliae and included an internal control for evaluation of inhibition due to the presence of PCR inhibitors in DNA extracted from soil samples. An excellent correlation was observed in regression analysis (R 2 = 0.96) between real-time PCR results and inoculum densities determined by soil plating in a range of field soils with pathogen densities as low as 1 to 2 microsclerotia/g of soil. Variation in copy number of the rDNA was also evaluated among isolates by SYBR Green real-time PCR amplification of the V. dahliae-specific amplicon compared with amplification of several single-copy genes and was estimated to range from ≈24 to 73 copies per haploid genome, which translated into possible differences in results among isolates of ≈1.8 cycle thresholds. Analysis of the variation in results of V. dahliae quantification among extractions of the same soil sample indicated that assaying four replicate DNA extractions for each field sample would provide accurate results. A TaqMan assay also was devel-oped to help identify colonies of V. tricorpus on soil plates.},

abstract = {Yield prediction is a major determinant of many management decisions for crop production. Farmers and their advisors want user-friendly decision support tools for predicting yield. Simulation models can be used to accurately predict yield, but they are complex and difficult to parameterise. The goal of this study is to build a simple and parsimonious model for predicting wheat yields that can be implemented in a decision tool to be used by farmers at a paddock level. A large yield data set accumulated from trials on commonly grown varieties in Western Australia is used to build and validate a generalised additive model (GAM) for predicting wheat yield. Explanatory variables tested included weather data and derivatives, geolocation, soil type, land capability, and wheat varieties. Model selection followed a forward stepwise approach in combination with cross-validation to select the smallest set of explanatory variables. The predictive performance is also evaluated using independent data. The final model uses seasonal water availability, location and year to predict wheat yield. Because the GAM model has minimal inputs, it can be easily employed in a decision tool to predict yield throughout the growing season using rainfall data up to the prediction date and either climatological averages or seasonal forecasts of rainfall for the remainder of the growing season. It also has the potential to be used as an input to agronomic models that predict the effect on yield of various management choices for fertiliser, pest, weed and disease management.},

abstract = {Crop losses caused by pests and weeds have been estimated at 42{\%} worldwide, with plant pathogens responsible for almost {\$}10 billion worth of damage in the USA in 1994 alone. Elevated carbon dioxide [ECO2] and associated climate change have the potential to accelerate plant pathogen evolution, which may, in turn, affect virulence. Plant-pathogen interactions under increasing CO2 concentrations have the potential to disrupt both agricultural and natural systems severely, yet the lack of experimental data and the subsequent ability to predict future outcomes constitutes a fundamental knowledge gap. Furthermore, nothing is known about the mechanistic bases of increasing pathogen agressiveness. In the absence of information on crop species, it is shown here that plant pathogen (Erysiphe cichoracearum) aggressiveness is increased under ECO2, together with changes in the leaf epidermal characteristics of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana L. Stomatal density, guard cell length, and trichome numbers on leaves developing post-infection are increased under ECO2 in direct contrast to non-infected responses. As many plant pathogens utilize epidermal features for successful infection, these responses provide a positive feedback mechanism facilitating an enhanced susceptibility of newly developed leaves to further pathogen attack. Furthermore, a screen of resistant and susceptible ecotypes suggest inherent differences in epidermal responses to ECO2.},

abstract = {Fusarium graminearum (Fg) can cause head blight and crown rot (CR) diseases of wheat but fungal colonisation and mycotoxin production by Fg during CR are little understood. Studies of an Australian strain of Fg demonstrated that expression of the Tri5 gene of Fg and deoxynivalenol (DON) production were induced during infection of the stem base and to levels equivalent to those observed in inoculated heads. To study fungal colonisation and DON production in CR disease, we inoculated stem bases, 14 days after sowing, with macroconidia of Australian and USA strains of Fg and of an Australian strain of Fusarium pseudograminearum, a related pathogen frequently associated with CR. At maturity, the fungal pathogen was subsequently detected by isolation on growth media in high percentages of plants at the stem base and the lowest node adjacent to the inoculation site (50-100{\%}), in the non-inoculated flag-leaf node (FLN) (35-95{\%}) and in asymptomatic non-inoculated mature heads (50-60{\%}) and kernels (20{\%}). Microscopic analysis suggested that colonisation of upper nodes occurred primarily via the pith parenchyma and lumen. Significant concentrations of DON (up to 35 ppm) were detected in the FLN and the head/rachis following inoculation of the stem base. To test the role of DON in CR a transgenic strain of Fg from the USA with the Tri5 gene deleted was compared with its original wild-type and these produced similar levels of CR lesion development and necrosis indicating that DON production was not necessary to cause CR disease symptoms. However, the DON-minus mutant was less frequently recovered from the FLN than the wild type suggesting that DON has a role in stem colonisation by the fungus. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Sources of partial resistance to crown rot caused by Fusarium pseudograminearum are detected in mature plants grown in artificially inoculated soil in the field. The resistance in most but not all of these sources can also be detected in seedlings. In order to determine whether partial resistance is related to depth of crown formation, this character was measured in 13 cultivars/lines with a range of reaction to crown rot. It was also measured in doubled haploid plants from the cross, Batavia/2-49. Crown depths varied from 17.1 mm to -2.3 mm (above ground) in pots in a waterbath at 25 degreesC and from 43.5 mm to 20.7 mm when plants were grown in the field. The correlation coefficient between relative susceptibility to crown rot (Field test) and crown depth of 13 cultivars/lines was 0.57 (p less than or equal to 0.05). With the exception of the cultivars, Sunco and Pelsart, partial resistance to crown rot was inversely related to depth of crown formation. This indicates that depth of crown formation may be partly responsible for the reaction of a cultivar/line to crown rot. Depth of crown formation was also measured in susceptible and partially resistant cultivars/lines grown from seed planted at different depths. As depth of seeding increased, depth of crown formation in partially resistant and susceptible cultivars/lines increased in similar proportions.},

Regression analysis of the field population showed that aggressiveness increased towards a resistant cultivar, but not towards a susceptible cultivar, that is no longer grown commercially. Here we report for the first time that aggressiveness increased on both cultivars after a few initial infection cycles at twice-ambient CO2 as isolates adapted to combat enhanced host resistance, while at ambient CO2 this increased steadily for most cycles as both cultivars selected for increased aggressiveness. Genetic fingerprint and karyotype of isolates changed for some CO2-cultivar combinations, but these were not related to changed aggressiveness. At 700 ppm fecundity increased for both isolates, and this increased population size, in combination with a conducive microclimate for anthracnose from an enlarged plant canopy under elevated CO2, could accelerate pathogen evolution.},

The data were used to construct a unique 160-yr time-series of the abundance of Phaeosphaeria nodorum and Mycosphaerella graminicola, two important pathogens of wheat. During the period since 1970, the relative abundance of DNA of these two pathogens in the samples has reflected the relative importance of the two wheat diseases they cause in U.K. disease surveys. Unexpectedly, changes in the ratio of the pathogens over the 160-yr period were very strongly correlated with changes in atmospheric pollution, as measured by SO2. emissions. This finding suggests that long-term, economically important, changes in pathogen populations can be influenced by anthropogenically induced environmental changes.},

abstract = {Cotton hardlock caused by Fusarium verticillioides (Sacc. Nirenberg) can reduce cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., yields Ͼ70{\%} in the southeastern United States. The spores infect {\ss}owers on the day of pollination, resulting in hardlock, which is the failure of the Þber to {\ss}uff as the boll opens at maturity. Frankliniella spp. Thrips (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) inhabiting the {\ss}owers are hypothesized to increase hardlock by spreading the conidia or by creating entranceways for the germinating Fusarium conidia. Experiments were conducted at Marianna and Quincy in Florida in 2006 and 2007 to determine whether there was a relationship between the number of adult and larval thrips inhabiting the {\ss}owers of cotton and the incidence of cotton hardlock. Frankliniella tritici (Fitch) was Ͼ98{\%} of the adult thrips in the samples at both locations each year. The adults of Frankliniella bispinosa (Morgan) and Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) also were collected. There were no signiÞcant regression relationships between weekly mean densities of thrips in the {\ss}owers and the incidence of cotton hardlock at harvest in any of the experiments. Additional experiments were conducted at each location in 2006 and 2007 to determine whether weekly applications during {\ss}owering of the insecticide lambda-cyhalothrin, the fungicide thiophanate methyl, and the combination of the two reduced the incidence of cotton hardlock at harvest. Applications of the insecticide signiÞcantly reduced the numbers of adult F. tritici, the number of thrips larvae, and the incidence of hardlock at harvest. Applications of the insecticide were as affective as applications of the insecticide plus fungicide. In one experiment, applications of the fungicide reduced the incidence of hardlock at harvest. Appli-cations of the insecticide usually signiÞcantly increased the number of adult F. occidentalis. None of the pesticide treatments signiÞcantly affected the numbers of the key thrips predator Orius insidiosus (Say). We conclude that insecticidal control of the adults and larvae of F. tritici during {\ss}owering reduced the incidence of cotton hardlock. However, there were no signiÞcant regression relationships between the incidence of cotton hardlock at harvest and the number of thrips in the {\ss}owers.},

abstract = {Climate change could strongly affect the wheat crop that accounts for 21 {\%} of food and 200 million hectares of farmland worldwide. This article reviews some of the approaches for addressing the expected effects that climate change may likely inflict on wheat in some of the most important wheat growing areas, namely germplasm adaptation, system management, and mitigation. Future climate scenarios suggest that global warming may be beneficial for the wheat crop in some regions, but could reduce productivity in zones where optimal temperatures already exist. For example, by 2050, as a result of possible climate shifts in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGPs) - currently part of the favorable, high potential, irrigated, low rainfall mega-environment, which accounts for 15{\%} of global wheat production - as much as 51 {\%} of its area might be reclassified as a heat-stressed, irrigated, short-season production mega-environment. This shift would also represent a significant reduction in wheat yields, unless appropriate cultivars and crop management practices were offered to and adopted by South Asian farmers, Under the same climate scenarios, the area covered by the cool, temperate wheat mega-environment could expand as far as 65 degrees N in both North America and Eurasia. To adapt and mitigate the climate change effects on wheat supplies for the poor, germiplasm scientists and agronomists are developing heat-tolerant wheat germplasm, as well as cultivars better adapted to conservation agriculture. Encouraging results include identifying sources of alleles for heat tolerance and their introgression into breeding populations through conventional methods and biotechnology. Likewise, agronomists and extension agents are aiming to cut CO2 emissions by reducing tillage and the burning of crop residues. Mitigation research promises to reduce emissions of nitrous oxide by using infrared sensors and the normalized differential vegetative index (NDVI) that determines the right times and correct amounts of fertilizer to apply. Wheat geneticists and physiologists are also assessing wild relatives of wheat as potential sources of genes with inhibitory effects on soil nitrification. Through the existing global and regional research-for-development networks featuring wheat, technology and knowledge can flow to allow farmers to face the risks associated with climate change.

They are transmitted intracellularly during cell division, sporogenesis, and/or cell-to-cell fusion (hyphal anastomosis), and thus their life cycles generally lack an extracellular phase. Their natural host ranges are limited to individuals within the same or closely related vegetative compatibility groups, although recent advances have established expanded experimental host ranges for some mycoviruses. Most known mycoviruses have dsRNA genomes packaged in isometric particles, but an increasing number of positive- or negative-strand ssRNA and ssDNA viruses have been isolated and characterized. Although many mycoviruses do not have marked effects on their hosts, those that reduce the virulence of their phytopathogenic fungal hosts are of considerable interest for development of novel biocontrol strategies. Mycoviruses that infect endophytic fungi and those that encode killer toxins are also of special interest. Structural analyses of mycoviruses have promoted better understanding of virus assembly, function, and evolution.},

We used a metamodel and considered three global climate models for the A2 greenhouse gas emission scenario for three 20-year time-slices: 2000–2019, 2040–2059 and 2080–2099. In addition to global analyses, five regions were evaluated where potato is an important crop: the Andean Highlands, Indo-Gangetic Plain and Himalayan Highlands, Southeast Asian Highlands, Ethiopian Highlands, and Lake Kivu Highlands in Sub-Saharan Africa. We found that the average global risk of potato late blight increases initially, when compared with historic climate data, and then declines as planting dates shift to cooler seasons. Risk in the agro-ecosystems analyzed, varied from a large increase in risk in the Lake Kivu Highlands in Rwanda to decreases in the Southeast Asian Highlands of Indonesia.},

abstract = {The manipulation of photoperiod sensitivity during stem elongation (terminal spikelet initiation--anthesis) has been suggested as a means to increase wheat yield potential. Nevertheless, photoperiod sensitivity and the interaction with vernalization during that phase have not been previously explored under field conditions. Thus, a field study was carried out (i) to assess whether duration of stem elongation is sensitive to photoperiod experienced only during that phase, and if so (ii) to evaluate whether vernalization interacts with this photoperiod response and (iii) to determine if altering duration of stem elongation may influence wheat yield and its components. The experiment was a factorial combination of two vernalization treatments (15 (V15) or 50 (V50) days at 4±1 °C and 8 h photoperiod), two photoperiod regimes during stem elongation (natural daylength in the field (NP+0) and one daylength extension of 6 h (NP+6)) and three cultivars (Buck Manantial (BM), Eureka Ferrocarril Sur (EFS), and ProINTA Puntal (PP)). The stem elongation phase responded to the actual photoperiod experienced during that phase in the three cultivars, increasing its duration with shorter photoperiod. In the vernalization-sensitive cultivars EFS and PP, plants vernalized 50 days showed greater response to photoperiod than those vernalized 15 days. In the most photoperiod-sensitive cultivar (BM), as duration of stem elongation lengthened by exposure to less inductive photoperiod, a higher number of fertile florets at anthesis was achieved leading to an increased grain number and thereby to a higher wheat yield. These results reinforce the idea that a longer duration of stem elongation may offer an alternative avenue to improve yield potential in wheat.},

Studies have documented a large negative sensitivity of crop yields to extreme daytime temperatures around 30°C. [Chapter 5 AR4, 7.3.2.1.1] These sensitivities have been identified for several crops and regions and exist throughout the growing season (high confidence). Several studies report that temperature trends are important for determining both past and future impacts of climate change on crop yields at sub-continental to global scales (medium confidence). [7.3.2, Box 7-1] At scales of individual countries or smaller, precipitation projections remain important but uncertain factors for assessing future impacts (high confidence). [7.3.2, Box 7-1]

Evidence since AR4 confirms the stimulatory effects of CO2 in most cases and the damaging effects of elevated tropospheric ozone on crop yields (high confidence). Experimental and modelling evidence indicate that interactions between CO2 and ozone, mean temperature, extremes, water and nitrogen are non-linear and difficult to predict (medium confidence). [7.3.2.1.2, Figure 7-2]

Changes in climate and CO2 concentration will enhance the distribution and increase the competiveness of agronomically important and invasive weeds (medium confidence). Rising CO2 may reduce the effectiveness of some herbicides (low confidence). The effects of climate change on disease pressure on food crops is uncertain, with evidence pointing to changed geographical ranges of pests and diseases but less certain changes in disease intensity (low confidence).

abstract = {Many ascomycete Fusarium spp. are plant pathogens that cause disease on both cereal and noncereal hosts. Infection of wheat ears by Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum typically results in bleaching and a subsequent reduction in grain yield. Also, a large proportion of the harvested grain can be spoiled when the colonizing Fusarium mycelia produce trichothecene mycotoxins, such as deoxynivalenol (DON). In this study, we have explored the intracellular polar metabolome of Fusarium spp. in both toxin-producing and nonproducing conditions in vitro. Four Fusarium spp., including nine well-characterized wild-type field isolates now used routinely in laboratory experimentation, were explored. A metabolic ?triple-fingerprint? was recorded using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance and direct-injection electrospray ionization?mass spectroscopy in both positive- and negative-ionization modes. These combined metabolomic analyses revealed that this technique is sufficient to resolve different wild-type isolates and different growth conditions. Principal components analysis was able to resolve the four species explored?F. graminearum, F. culmorum, F. pseudograminearum, and F. venenatum?as well as individual isolate differences from the same species. The external nutritional environment was found to have a far greater influence on the metabolome than the genotype of the organism. Conserved responses to DON-inducing medium were evident and included increased abundance of key compatible solutes, such as glycerol and mannitol. In addition, the concentration of ?-aminobutyric acid was elevated, indicating that the cellular nitrogen status may be affected by growth on DON-inducing medium.},

Using a multiple-choice olfactometer, Tribolium confusum and Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) adults were shown to respond to 4,R-8,R-dimethyldecanal, their natural aggregation pheromone, and to distinguish between this and other diastereomers when tested simultaneously. The S-R and S-S diastereomers may be slightly inhibitory to T. castaneum response. Tribolium confusum was attracted to racemic 4, 8-dimethyldecanal applied to rubber septa lures. High doses of the pheromone reduced attraction. The pheromone is currently being used with food attractants in the trap for monitoring field populations of Tribolium and other stored-product insects. ?? 1985.},

abstract = {An RNA silencing construct was used to alter mycotoxin production in the plant pathogenic fungus Fusarium culmorum, the incitant of crown and foot rot on wheat. The transformation of a wild-type strain and its nitrate reductase-deficient mutant with inverted repeat transgenes (IRTs) containing sequences corresponding to the trichothecene regulatory gene TRI6 was achieved using hygromycin B resistance as a selectable marker. Southern analysis revealed a variety of integration patterns of the TRI6 IRT. One transformant underwent homologous recombination with deletion of the endogenous TRI6 gene, whereas, in another transformant, the TRI6 IRT was not integrated into the genome. The TRI6 IRT did not alter the physiological characteristics, such as spore production, pigmentation or growth rate, on solid media. In most transformants, a high TRI6 amplification signal was detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, corresponding to a TRI6-hybridizing smear of degraded fragments by Northern analysis, whereas TRI5 expression decreased compared with the respective non-transformed strain. Four transformants showed increased TRI5 expression, which was correlated with a dramatic (up to 28-fold) augmentation of deoxynivalenol production. Pathogenicity assays on durum wheat seedlings confirmed that impairment of deoxynivalenol production in the TRI6 IRT transformants correlated with a loss of virulence, with decreased disease indices ranging from 40{\%} to 80{\%} in nine silenced strains, whereas the overproducing transformants displayed higher virulence compared with the wild-type.},

Efforts to elucidate the physiological mechanisms responsible for growth and yield reductions have been inconclusive . Field experiments were conducted in 1987 and 1989 to document the influence of verticillium wilt on the photosynthetic and respiratory activity of cotton leaves . A portable gas-exchange measurement system was used to determine changes in net photosynthesis, photorespiration and dark respiration of lower-, middle-and upper canopy leaves of control and diseased plants . In addition, changes in stomatal behavior and chlorophyll content were also determined . Photosynthesis of diseased lower-canopy leaves was reduced by over 6 .5 ° " compared to controls, and the reduction was associated with chlorophyll loss, a more negative leaf water potential, and a greatly reduced stomatal conductance . Upper-canopy leaves of diseased plants, although showing no visible symptoms of verticillium wilt, exhibited a 20°, decrease in photosynthetic activity which was independent of changes in chlorophyll or leaf water potential . Verticillium wilt reduced dark respiration of asymptomatic, upper-canopy leaves by4{\_} photorespiration by 27 °,-;, and increased mesophyll resistance by 46 °o . Our results suggest that the pathogen reduced photosynthesis initially through nonstomatal processes, which were not directly mediated by water-deficit stress . In contrast, leaves with symptoms exhibited decreased photosynthesis due to combined chlorosis, water stress, and stomatal closure . Disease progression and the resultant decrease in photosynthetic capacity apparently is the product of two distinct mechanisms of pathogenicity .},

abstract = {This invited review and opinion piece, assesses the impact of climate change on mycotoxins in food: only one paper and an abstract referred directly from a substantial literature search and then only in relation to Europe. Climate change is an accepted probability by most scientists. Favourable temperature and water activity are crucial for mycotoxigenic fungi and mycotoxin production. Fungal diseases of crops provide relevant information for pre-harvest mycotoxin contamination. However, the mycotoxin issue also involves post-harvest scenarios. There are no data on how mycotoxins affect competing organisms in crop ecosystems. In general, if the temperature increases in cool or temperate climates, the relevant countries may become more liable to aflatoxins. Tropical countries may become too inhospitable for conventional fungal growth and mycotoxin production. Could this lead to the extinction of thermotolerant Aspergillus flavus? Currently cold regions may become liable to temperate problems concerning ochratoxin A, patulin and Fusarium toxins (e.g. deoxynivalenol). Regions which can afford to control the environment of storage facilities may be able to avoid post-harvest problems but at high additional cost. There appears to be a lack of awareness of the issue in some non-European countries. The era will provide numerous challenges for mycotoxicologists. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

The use of nested primers greatly decreased the number of nonspecific amplification products. Polymerase chain reaction products were not obtained with DNA from seedlings infected with several other phytopathogenic fungi or with DNA from uninfected seedlings. Amplified products were visualized on agarose gels, and their identities were confirmed by DNA hybridization. This method did not require culturing the fungus and has potential for detecting G. graminis in infested wheat, barley, or oat fields.},

abstract = {Reducing the tillage and application of mulch are important strategies for soil and water conservation and sustainability of agricultural systems. Soil can be a source or sink for carbon (C) depending on management strategies and plays a major role in the global C cycle. These interacting practices can alter nutrient movement and availability to the crops, reduce water loss, slow down organic-matter (OM) decomposition, and thus enhance C sequestration. A 2-year field study was conducted to quantify the tillage and mulching effect on soil organic C (SOC), OM, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) at two depths (i.e., 0-15 and 15-30 cm deep) in the soil profile and N, P, and K concentrations (g kg-1) in plant shoots at harvest on a Typic Calciargids in wheat-maize rotation. The four tillage systems used were zero tillage (ZT), minimum tillage (MT), conventional tillage (CT), and deep tillage (DT), and four mulch rates [control, 2 (M2), 4 (M4), and 6 (M6) Mg ha-1 year-1 wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw] were applied in combination with each tillage system, keeping recommended rates of fertilizers. There was a linear positive response of mulch application on SOC for both years, but it was more pronounced during the second year. Greater values were found in ZT and the lowest in CT at all depths, although greater SOC content was found in upper layers than in deeper ones. Greater shoot N, P, and K concentrations were found in MT, CT, and DT, whereas the lowest concentration was found in ZT. Mulch application has no effect on N, P, and K concentrations in shoots. The soil N concentration was not affected by tillage and mulch, yet greater soil N content was found at 0-15 cm than 15-30 cm deep. There was significant effect of tillage on soil P and K during one year as greater P and K concentrations were found under MT, CT, and DT compared to ZT. More N, P, K, and OM concentrations were found at 0-15 cm deep than at 15-30 cm deep during the whole study period. Mulch effect was significant on K, and significantly greater amounts were found at greater levels of mulch application. The increases in the soil OM were 34.5, 35.75, and 24{\%} at 0-8, 8-16, and 16-24 cm deep respectively from the first year to the second year. Tillage effect on soil organic-matter content was not significant. Tillage increased grain production for both years. For the first year, 22.9 and 27{\%} greater yields were found in CT and DT, whereas in the second year yields were 10.6, 17.9, and 57{\%} greater, respectively, in MT, CT, and DT as compared to ZT. Grain production was increased at a result of mulch application by 12.9, 20.3, and 10.6{\%} during the first year and 11.45, 23.74, and 10.9{\%} during the second year as compared to control (i.e., without mulch). Results show the importance of mulch application and crop residue retention. Both can increase the SOC content and water-holding capacity, which will result in improved production and soil physical health over long and continuous use of mulch.},

abstract = {Ascochyta blight is one of the most important diseases affecting field peas. The disease occurs in almost all pea-growing regions of the world and can cause significant crop losses when conditions are favourable for an epidemic. Here we review current knowledge of the epidemiology of the disease. Details are provided of disease symptoms, the disease cycle and the taxonomy of the causal fungi, Ascochyta pisi, Mycosphaerella pinodes and Phoma pinodella. The importance of seed-, soil- and air-borne inoculum is discussed along with the factors that influence survival of the causal fungi in soil, on seed or associated with pea trash. Many studies have been reviewed to establish how the fungi responsible for the disease survives from year to year, how the disease becomes established in new crops and the conditions that favour disease development. Evidence is provided that crop rotation, destruction of infected pea trash and chemical seed treatments can significantly reduce the amount of primary inoculum. Later sowing of crops has been shown to reduce the incidence and severity of disease. Fungicides have been used successfully to control the disease, although the cost of their application can significantly reduce the profitability of the crop. The best long-term strategy for effective disease control appears to be the development of ascochyta blight resistant pea varieties. Reports of physiological specialisation in ascochyta blight fungi are also documented. Despite extensive screening of germplasm, relatively few sources of resistance to ascochyta blight fungi have been found in Pisum sativum. However, the discovery of much better sources of resistance in closely related species and the development of advanced breeding methods offer new possibilities for developing useful resistance.},

abstract = {Following inoculation of the base of soft wheat seedlings with Fusarium culmorum, disease symptoms typical of crown rot developed at the stem base and extended up to the third node by plant maturity. Fungus was isolated from all tissues exhibiting symptoms but not from symptomless tissues. Histopathological analysis revealed that the fungus was present mainly in the parenchymatic cells of the stem base and colonized the tissues via apoplastic and symplastic pathways. Host response in advance of pathogen colonization was observed. At maturity, plants were divided into sections from the inoculated area to the head. Heads were also separated into grain, rachis and chaff components. Colonization by the fungus was assessed by isolation from surface-sterilized segments and quantified by real-time PCR. Disease symptoms and the fungus were detected up to the third node, while deoxynivalenol (DON) was present in all stem segments and heads. Within the head, the DON concentration was higher in the rachis than in the chaff and grain components. These results demonstrate that F. culmorum can extensively colonize stem tissues but not reach the head by the time of plant maturity. In contrast, DON was detected in tissues beyond those colonized by the fungus, translocating to the head where, although accumulating mainly in the rachis, significant quantities accumulated in the grain. These findings indicate that there is a potential threat of contamination of grain with DON where severe crown rot is present in a crop.},

abstract = {Insect pollination, despite its potential to contribute substantially to crop production, is not an integrated part of agronomic planning. A major reason for this are knowledge gaps in the contribution of pollinators to yield, which partly result from difficulties in determining area-based estimates of yield effects from insect pollination under field conditions. We have experimentally manipulated honey bee Apis mellifera densities at 43 oilseed rape Brassica napus fields over 2 years in Scandinavia. Honey bee hives were placed in 22 fields; an additional 21 fields without large apiaries in the surrounding landscape were selected as controls. Depending on the pollination system in the parental generation, the B. napus cultivars in the crop fields are classified as either open-pollinated or first-generation hybrids, with both types being open-pollinated in the generation of plants cultivated in the fields. Three cultivars of each type were grown. We measured the activity of flower-visiting insects during flowering and estimated yields by harvesting with small combine harvesters. The addition of honey bee hives to the fields dramatically increased abundance of flower-visiting honey bees in those fields. Honey bees affected yield, but the effect depended on cultivar type (p = 0.04). Post-hoc analysis revealed that open-pollinated cultivars, but not hybrid cultivars, had 11{\%} higher yields in fields with added honey bees than those grown in the control fields (p = 0.07). To our knowledge, this is the first whole-field study in replicated landscapes to assess the benefit of insect pollination in oilseed rape. Our results demonstrate that honey bees have the potential to increase oilseed rape yields, thereby emphasizing the importance of pollinator management for optimal cultivation of oilseed rape.},

Rising temperature and increasing CO2 coupled with an increase in variability of precipitation will create a complex set of interactions on plant growth and water use. These interactions of temperature, CO2, and rainfall patterns within the growing season will affect plant growth in many different ways. The interaction of these parameters is complex; however, are further exaggerated by rainfall patterns during the growing season. Water is a dominant factor that will override the positive impacts of CO2 increases and further diminish plant growth and yield when coupled with temperature stresses.

abstract = {Fusarium species involved in the Fusarium crown rot (FCR) complex affect wheat in every stage of development from seedling to grain fill. This study was designed to compare the aggressiveness of the FCR complex members including F. culmorum, F. pseudograminearum and F. graminearum in causing seedling blight, decreased plant vigour and crown rot. To assess their relative pathogenicity, two hard red spring wheat cultivars and two durum wheat cultivars were inoculated in the field with five isolates from each of the three species for two years. Significant differences in patterns of pathogenicity were identified. In particular, F. culmorum caused greater seedling blight while F. pseudograminearum and F. graminearum caused greater crown rot. Greatest yield reductions were caused by F. pseudograminearum. Cultivar differences were identified with respect to seedling disease and late season crown rot. No interactions were identified between cultivar performance and isolates or species with which they were challenged.},
annote = {Dyer, Alan T. Johnston, Robert H. Hogg, Andrew C. Johnston, Jeffrey A.
The primary objectives of this study were to 
(1) compare virulence and aggressiveness of F. culmorum, F. pseudograminearum and F. graminearum on spring and durum wheat (Triticum turgidum var. durum) 
(2) determine if isolates within species vary in their patterns of pathogenicity and 
(3) determine whether variation in tolerance among cultivars is dependent on isolates and/or species with which they are challenged. 
To address these objectives, inoculated field trials were conducted during the summers of 2005 and 2006 using fifteen Fusarium isolates and two popular cultivars of hard red spring and durum wheat.

while F. culmorum is capable of surviving between cycles as durable chlamydospores in the soil as well as in plant residue (Sitton and Cook 1981; Pereyra and Dill-Macky 2004). Not requiring residues for survival may allow F. culmorum to be a more aggressive seedling pathogen and preclude it from causing severe crown rot as lower plant stands generally decrease crown rot severity later in the season due to decreased water stress (Cook, 1980). Previous work has indicated that F. pseudograminearum is more active in warmer (Cook 1981) and wetter environments (Smiley and Patterson 1996). This seems partially confirmed in this study where F. pseudograminearum showed it was capable of aggressively attacking seedlings in the warmer, wetter spring of 2006 but not in 2005.

it is worth noting that despite differences in seedling blight and late season disease, tiller densities did not differ significantly among isolates and were therefore probably not the source of yield differences described.

Similar to the results of others (Smiley et al. 2005a), patterns of pathogenicity and aggressiveness among isolates varied according to trial year. Why
this occurs is unknown. For this study, assessment of inoculum, seed quality and cultural practices has not identified significant sources of this variation. Whether uncontrolled factors like climate interact with isolate variability to create these yearly differences needs to be addressed.

This study did not identify any species or isolate specific resistance as no interactions between cultivar performance and isolates were identified. Significant interactions occurred between yield and other response variables including DSI, stand, and vigour ratings. The strongest of these was the
interaction between DSI and yield, where a significant correlation was detected across both years of this study. This correlation was not surprising as crown rot primarily affects plants during grain fill. In contrast to crown rot, stand and vigour ratings only correlated with yield in the second year of this trial when large stand losses were experienced. Yield losses due to reductions in stand are often minimised by the ability of neighbouring wheat plants to compensate for losses in stand. Both vigour and percent stand reflect the impacts of relatively early season infections and correlated well with each other in this study},

abstract = {Anthropogenic impacts increasingly drive ecological and evolutionary processes at many spatio-temporal scales, demanding greater capacity to predict and manage their consequences. This is particularly true for agro-ecosystems, which not only comprise a significant proportion of land use, but which also involve conflicting imperatives to expand or intensify production while simultaneously reducing environmental impacts. These imperatives reinforce the likelihood of further major changes in agriculture over the next 30-40years. Key transformations include genetic technologies as well as changes in land use. The use of evolutionary principles is not new in agriculture (e.g. crop breeding, domestication of animals, management of selection for pest resistance), but given land-use trends and other transformative processes in production landscapes, ecological and evolutionary research in agro-ecosystems must consider such issues in a broader systems context. Here, we focus on biotic interactions involving pests and pathogens as exemplars of situations where integration of agronomic, ecological and evolutionary perspectives has practical value. Although their presence in agro-ecosystems may be new, many traits involved in these associations evolved in natural settings. We advocate the use of predictive frameworks based on evolutionary models as pre-emptive management tools and identify some specific research opportunities to facilitate this. We conclude with a brief discussion of multidisciplinary approaches in applied evolutionary problems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The response of plant disease to weather variables such as temperature and precipitation is well known, and has been the basis for disease forecasting models used in decision-making by farmers and policy makers. Thus, plant disease risk can readily shift under climate change. Predicting changes in risk under climate change is complicated by the many biological interactions that result in disease. For example, some plant diseases occur when the phenology of plant and pathogen are aligned, in the case of Fusarium head blight so that spores are ready to infect during wheat flowering. There are numerous examples of experiments involving simulated climate change that have shown changes in disease risk. Finding indicators of climate change effects on disease in real agricultural or natural systems is more challenging because of the correlative nature of the observations and the potential for many other factors to influence disease, such as changes in host abundance. Assessments of global disease databases suggest some pathogen range shifts consistent with predicted outcomes for climate change. There are also several cases of emerging tree diseases in which climate change has likely played a role.},

The potential impacts of change in climate are reviewed from the perspective of the FGSC life cycle and host resistance mechanisms influenced by abiotic pressures at the ecological, physiological and molecular level. Alterations in climate patterns and cropping systems may affect the distribution, composition and load of FGSC inoculum, but quantitative information is lacking regarding the differential responses among FGSC members.

abstract = {Synergistic interactions between entomopathogenic micro-organisms can potentially be exploited to improve biological control of invertebrate pests but empirical data at the population level describing multiple-pathogen transmission dynamics is lacking. We examined how co-inoculation of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk) and the baculovirus Panolis flammea nucleopolyhedrovirus (PaflNPV) in an experimental field population of Lepidopteran Mamestra brassicae larvae impacted on viral transmission dynamics. We determined how the presence of Btk influenced primary and secondary PaflNPV transmission. When Btk was co-inoculated with PaflNPV, there was increased proportional viral mortality in primary transmission studies compared to plots with virus alone. A delay of up to 4. days between applications of Btk and PaflNPV did not impact on primary viral mortality, indicating that a lag between inoculations was unlikely to affect the biocontrol potential of the two pathogens. Viral yields from cadavers in plots with Btk present were significantly lower than those from plots with virus only, and secondary cycling to introduced secondary transmission larvae was significantly reduced. Baculovirus transmission (in terms of the proportion of uninfected larvae in different treatments) was described by a 'refuge' model that allowed for heterogeneity in susceptibility and pathogen exposure. We discuss how transmission may be potentially affected by factors such as host feeding rate, spatial distribution of virus and interactions between pathogens within the insect host. This study improves understanding of the impact of pathogens within host populations and how mixtures of pathogens may be exploited for biocontrol of insect pests.},

abstract = {Canopy-level interactions have been largely ignored in epidemiological models and their applications in defining disease risks under climate change, although these interactions are important for disease management. This paper uses anthracnose of Stylosanthes scabra as a case study and reviews research on dynamics of the pathogen (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides) at the canopy level and pathogen evolution under changing climate. It argues that linking of pathogen dynamics, crop growth and climate models is essential in predicting disease risks under climate change. A plant functional-structural model was used to couple S. scabra growth and architecture with disease under ambient and elevated CO2. A level of induced resistance in plants with enlarged canopy determined anthracnose severity at elevated CO2. Moisture-related microclimatic variables determined infection at ambient but not at elevated CO2. At high CO2 increased disease level from raised pathogen fecundity in enlarged canopy accelerated pathogen evolution after 25 sequential infection cycles. Modelling of pathogen dynamics under climate change currently suffers from a paucity of quantitative data, mismatch of scales in coupling climate and disease models, and model uncertainties. Further experimental research on interactions of biotic and abiotic factors on plant diseases under climate change and validation of models are essential prior to their use in climate-change prediction. Understanding and anticipating trends in host–pathogen evolution under climate change will improve the durability of resistance and lay the foundation for increased crop adaptation through pre-emptive plant breeding.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}Continuous planting of crops containing single disease resistance (R) genes imposes a strong selection for virulence in pathogen populations, often rendering the R gene ineffective. Increasing environmental temperatures may complicate R-gene-mediated disease control because high temperatures often promote disease development and reduce R gene effectiveness. Here, performance of one rice bacterial blight disease R gene was assessed in field and growth chamber studies to determine the influence of temperature on R gene effectiveness and durability. Disease severity and virulence of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) populations were monitored in field plots planted to rice with and without the bacterial blight R gene Xa7 over 11 yr. The performance of Xa7 was determined in high- and low-temperature regimes in growth chambers. Rice with Xa7 exhibited less disease than lines without Xa7 over 11 yr, even though virulence of Xoo field populations increased. Xa7 restricted disease more effectively at high than at low temperatures. Other R genes were less effective at high temperatures. We propose that Xa7 restricts disease and Xoo population size more efficiently in high temperature cropping seasons compared with cool seasons creating fluctuating selection, thereby positively impacting durability of Xa7.},

abstract = {A range of inoculation methods for assessing resistance in wheat to crown rot caused by Fusarium graminearum Group 1 was evaluated in the glasshouse and in the field. When grain was colonized with the pathogen, ground and applied with the seed at planting or spread around young plants as an aqueous suspension, high levels of crown rot were produced, but resistance (usually measured as per cent diseased plants or tillers) was still expressed. Similar results were achieved with induced field inoculum obtained by inoculating an area of wheat to obtain a high incidence of disease and incorporating the stubble into the soil. Natural field inoculum and inoculation of seed with spores produced lower levels of disease, although differentiation of resistant and susceptible cultivars was still possible. Other methods, suitable only for plants in pots and often for more specific purposes (for example, for inoculation at different stages of plant growth) were also studied. Resistance was best expressed where inoculum was applied onto or into soil, rather than directly onto or into plants. Currently, the resistance of all potential cultivars for release in Queensland is assessed in the field by sowing seed dusted with benomyl into furrows along which ground, colonized grain is distributed. Crown rot severity is then determined at maturity.},

To investigate these crop-disease-climate interactions, UKCIP02 scenarios predicting UK temperature and rainfall under high-and low-CO(2) emission scenarios for the 2020s and 2050s were combined with a crop-simulation model predicting yield of fungicide-treated winter oilseed rape and with a weather-based regression model predicting severity of phoma stem canker epidemics. The combination of climate scenarios and crop model predicted that climate change will increase yield of fungicide-treated oilseed rape crops in Scotland by up to 0.5 t ha(-1) (15{\%}). In contrast, in southern England the combination of climate scenarios, crop, disease and yield loss models predicted that climate change will increase yield losses from phoma stem canker epidemics to up to 50 per cent (1.5 t ha(-1)) and greatly decrease yield of untreated winter oilseed rape. The size of losses is predicted to be greater for winter oilseed rape cultivars that are susceptible than for those that are resistant to the phoma stem canker pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans. Such predictions illustrate the unexpected, contrasting impacts of aspects of climate change on crop-disease interactions in agricultural systems in different regions.},

abstract = {Abstract Climate change has a number of observed, anticipated, or possible consequences on crop health worldwide. Global change, on the other hand, incorporates a number of drivers of change, including global population increase, natural resource evolution, and supply?demand shifts in markets, from local to global. Global and climate changes interact in their effects on global ecosystems. Identifying and quantifying the impacts of global and climate changes on plant diseases is complex. A number of nonlinear relationships, such as the injury (epidemic)?damage (crop loss) relationship, are superimposed on the interplay among the three summits of the disease triangle (host, pathogen, environment). Work on a range of pathosystems involving rice, peanut, wheat, and coffee has shown the direct linkage and feedback between production situations and crop health. Global and climate changes influence the effects of system components on crop health. The combined effects of global and climate changes on diseases vary from one pathosystem to another within the tetrahedron framework (humans, pathogens, crops, environment) where human beings, from individual farmers to consumers to entire societies, interact with hosts, pathogens, and the environment. This article highlights international phytopathological research addressing the effects of global and climate changes on plant diseases in a range of crops and pathosystems.},

abstract = {Over 1300 nitrate nonutilizing (nit) mutants were recovered from 7 strs of F. oxysporum cultured on 2 media, potato-dextrose agar or minimal agar, amended with 1.5{\%} potassium chlorate. The mutants could be divided into 3 phenotypic classes by their growth on supplemented minimal agar medium. These classes were thought to reflect mutations at a nitrate reductase structural locus (nit1), a nitrate-assimilation pathway-specific regulatory locus (nit3) and loci (at least 5) that affect the assembly of a molybdenum-containing cofactor necessary for nitrate reductase activity (NitM). Nit mutants in each phenotypic class were recovered from each of the 7 strs of F. oxysporum tested. The majority (59-96{\%}) of nit mutants recovered were nit1 mutants. With all 7 strs, nit3 and NitM mutants were recovered at a much higher frequency from minimal agar medium amended with chlorate than from potato-dextrose agar amended with chlorate. For 6 of the 7 strs, physiological complementation occurred (as a result of heterokaryon formation) between the different nit mutant phenotypes derived from the same parental str. Complementation was also observed between some nit mutants with the same phenotype. No complementation was observed between any of the nit mutants recovered from a str. of F. o. f.sp. melonis; this str. has been designated heterokaryon self-incompatible. The phenotypes of complementary nit mutants (arbitrarily designated nitA and nitB) recovered by other workers in 3 previous studies were also determined. Neither the nitA nor the nitB mutants corresponded with a particular mutant phenotype; all 3 phenotypes were found among the nitA and nitB mutants. With the exception of the heterokaryon self-incompatible str., all nit1 and nit3 mutants from an individual str. readily complemented the NitM mutants derived from the same str. The NitM mutants form heterokaryons rapidly and reliably and should be used as one of the nit mutant testers to identify the vegetative compatibility group to which isolates of F. oxysporum belong. It is concluded that several procedures should expedite the screening of natural populations of F. oxysporum for vegetative compatibility.},

abstract = {Didymella pinodes is the principal causal agent of ascochyta blight, one of the most important fungal diseases of pea (Pisum sativum) worldwide. Understanding its host specificity has crucial implications in epidemiology and management; however, this has not been clearly delineated yet. In this study we attempt to clarify the host range of D. pinodes and to compare it with that of other close Didymella spp. D. pinodes was very virulent on pea accessions, although differences in virulence were identified among isolates. On the contrary, studied isolates of D. fabae, D. rabiei, and D. lentil showed a reduced ability to infect pea not causing macroscopically visible symptoms on any of the pea accessions tested. D. pinodes isolates were also infective to some extend on almost all species tested including species such as Hedysarum coronarium, Lathyrus sativus, Lupinus albus, Medicago spp., Trifolium spp., Trigonella foenum-graecum, and Vicia articulata which were not mentioned before as hosts of D. pinodes. On the contrary, D. lentil and D. rabiei were more specific, infecting only lentil and chickpea, respectively. D. fabae was intermediate, infecting mainly faba bean, but also slightly other species such as Glycine max, Phaseolus vulgaris, Trifolium spp., Vicia sativa, and V. articulata. DNA sequence analysis of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) was performed to confirm identity of the isolates studies and to determine phylogenetic relationship among the Didymella species, revealing the presence of two clearly distinct clades. Clade one was represented by two supported subclusters including D. fabae isolates as well as D. rabiei with D. lentil isolates. Clade two was the largest and included all the D. pinodes isolates as well as Phoma medicaginis var. pinodella. Genetic distance between D. pinodes and the other Didymella spp. isolates was not correlated with overall differences in pathogenicity. Based on evidences presented here, D. pinodes is not specialized on pea and its host range is larger than that of D. fabae, D. lentil, and D. rabiei. This has relevant implications in epidemiology and control as these species might act as alternative hosts for D. pinodes.},

abstract = {Agricultural system simulation models are key tools for assessment of possible impacts of climate change on crop production and environmental quality. In this study, the CERES-Wheat 4.0 module in the RZWQM2 model was calibrated and validated for simulating spring wheat grown under elevated CO2 conditions in the FACE (Free Air CO2 Enrichment) experiments conducted at Maricopa, Arizona, USA from 1992 to 1997. The validated model was then used to simulate the possible impacts of climate change on the crop for a 16-year period centered on 2050 with a projected atmospheric CO2 concentration of 550 ppm. Sixteen General Circulation Model (GCM) projections of climate in response to this CO2 concentration were used for this purpose. In the FACE experiment, the crops were grown under ambient (365-370 ppm) and elevated (similar to 550 ppm) CO2 concentrations with two irrigation treatments (wet and dry) in 1992-1993 and 1993-1994, and two nitrogen (N) treatments (high and low N) in 1995-1996 and 1996-1997 crop seasons. The model simulated crop growth and grain yield, and soil water responses to CO2 reasonably well, reproducing variations due to the treatments. Under ambient CO2 in 1992-1993 and 1995-1996, biomass was simulated better in the dry and low N treatments with root mean square difference (RMSD) of 181 and 161 kg ha(-1), respectively, compared to the wet and high N treatments with RMSD of 259 and 268 kg ha(-1), respectively. The effects of water and N treatments were higher than those of CO2, and the model reproduced these effects well. Elevated CO2 effects on crop growth were counterbalanced by temperature effects, and projected precipitation had little effect on the simulated crop. The model results provide reasonable confidence for simulations of possible impacts of projected climate change on wheat crop growth in the region, within normal field data uncertainties.

We compared the abundance and diversity of soil nematodes from a wheat field with high (225.0 kg N ha(-1)) and low (112.5 kg N -ha(-1)) levels of N fertilisation exposed to the elevated and ambient CO2 during the wheat growing season in 2005. The results showed that elevated CO2 and N fertilisation had significant effects on the abundance and diversity of soil nematodes. Elevated CO2 increased the abundance of omnivores-predators, the values of maturity index (MI) and structural index (SI) of nematode assemblage at the jointing stage of wheat. Two levels of N fertilisation had significant effects on the abundance of fungivores at the wheatjointing stage, while nematode channel ratio (NCR) showed responses to different N fertilisation and the interaction effects of elevated CO2 and N fertilisation at the wheat ripening stage.

abstract = {The Bacillus cereus group comprises a diverse array of non-pathogenic bacteria as well as pathogens such as Bacillus thuringiensis. Their spores are found together in soil and leaves and are therefore likely to commonly interact within hosts. Mixed infections of pathogenic B. thuringiensis and non-pathogenic strains have been little studied, despite their potential impact on biological control and the evolutionary ecology of virulence. Antibiotic secreting strains of B. cereus have been shown to be able to synergize B. thuringiensis (Bt) infections. We explored the ecology of these mixed infections more broadly in the diamondback moth (DBM). We tested whether antibiotic-expressing B. cereus can synergize Bt infections initiated with spores, investigated whether ingestion of antibiotic-expressing B. cereus had any consequences for the larval gut flora and whether synergistic interactions with B. cereus increase Bt reproduction. Ingestion of high-antibiotic secreting B. cereus synergized infections of B. thuringiensis in diamondback moth larvae, but at a lower level than previously reported. Coinfection also increased slightly the number of Bt spores found in cadavers. Culture independent analysis of gut homogenates indicated that ingestion of an antibiotic-expressing strain of B. cereus reduced the abundance of the gut flora and led to gut communities being dominated bacteria with DGGE profiles very similar to pure B. cereus cultures. Ingestion of B. cereus, regardless of genotype, reduced densities of an enteric isolate of Enterobacter sp. These findings support the hypothesis that antibiotic secretion in the gut synergizes B. thuringiensis infections by reducing the abundance of the commensal gut flora and facilitating invasion by bacteria in the B. cereus group. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

A mycological survey carried out throughout these regions, revealed that 78{\%} of the prospected fields were infested. Results of the morphological and molecular identification, showed that the most common species isolated from diseased wheat spikes was Microdochium nivale var. nivale (63.5{\%}), followed by Fusarium culmorum (26{\%}), F. pseudograminearum (9{\%}) and F. avenaceum (1.5{\%}). To evaluate mycotoxin content of naturally infected grain, the amounts of trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) in harvested grain from 45 fields were quantified by RIDASCREEN DON Enzyme Immunoassay Kit (ELISA). This study showed that the infection levels in freshly harvested grain were very low and the maximum deoxynivalenol (DON) level of the positive samples was 53 ppb. This is the first report on the natural occurrence of DON in naturally infected wheat grain sampled from Northern Tunisia.},

abstract = {Differential detection assays employing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of sequence-characterized amplified regions were developed for Fusarium culmorum, F. graminearum, and F. avenaceum. Unique fragments from randomly amplified polymorphic DNA profiles that differentiated F. culmorum and F. graminearum were cloned and sequenced. Based on the sequences, pairs of 20-mer oligonucleotide primers were designed to yield distinguishable amplicons of different molecular weight. Single fragments were amplified with each of the primer pairs that were specific for F. culmorum and F. graminearum. Screening a broad range of isolates of Fusarium spp., other cereal pathogens, and potential host plants revealed no significant cross-reactions for any assay. The assays were capable of detecting less than 10(-12) g of fungal DNA and enabled the detection of individual Fusarium spp. directly in extracts of infected stem tissue and grains of rye and wheat showing disease symptoms. Additionally, internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA were amplified with universal primers and analyzed for sequence variation among the species. The ITS sequences of F. culmorum and F. graminearum were not polymorphic enough to design species-specific primers. ITS-1 and -2 of both species were compared to those of F. avenaceum and revealed sufficient sequence variation, especially in ITS-2, to derive primers for specific amplification of F: avenaceum. These specific, sensitive PCR assays represent valuable, versatile new tools for diagnosis, epidemiology, screening of breeding material for Fusarium resistance, and fungal population genetics.},

abstract = {The relationship between rice cropping practices, biotic constraints, and rice yield levels in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh, India was studied. The investigation was conducted at the centre of a geographic area representative of the rice-wheat system of South Asia, and covers a large diversity of production situations undergoing intensification. A survey procedure was used to collect data for 3 consecutive years (1993-1995) in 251 individual farmers' fields. Two analytical approaches were used, the emphasis shifting from yield determining variables, that are mostly qualitative in nature, to quantitative, and predominantly yield-reducing, variables. The first approach was intended to characterize relationships among variables using cluster and correspondence analyses, while the second approach was aimed at generating yield loss estimates using combinations of principal components and step-wise multiple regressions. Seven patterns of cropping practices were distinguished, reflecting a wide variation in production situations, especially in terms of use of fertilizers and manure, and degree of water control. Six types of disease profiles, four insect injury profiles, and four weed infestation patterns were identified. Correspondence analysis, based on patterns of cropping practices and injury profiles, yielded a path of increasing attainable yield associated with varying levels of intensification and combinations of injuries. The use of principal component analysis with multiple regression generated estimates of yield reductions due to rice diseases, insects and weeds. The analysis highlighted the effects of changes in patterns of cropping practices on injuries caused by weeds, brown spot, sheath blight and dead hearts. The significance of these findings with respect to current and future IPM needs is discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Climate change will affect both growth of agricultural crops and diseases that attack them but there has been little work to study how its impacts on crop growth influence impacts on disease epidemics. This paper investigates how impacts of climate change on wheat anthesis date will influence impacts on fusarium ear blight in UK mainland arable areas. A wheat growth model was used for projections of anthesis dates, and a weather-based model was developed for use in projections of incidence of fusarium ear blight in the UK. Daily weather data, generated for 14 sites in arable areas of the UK for a baseline (1960-1990) scenario and for high and low CO(2) emissions in the 2020s and 2050s, were used to project wheat anthesis dates and fusarium ear blight incidence for each site for each climate change scenario. Incidence of fusarium ear blight was related to rainfall during anthesis and temperature during the preceding 6 weeks. It was projected that, with climate change, wheat anthesis dates will be earlier and fusarium ear blight epidemics will be more severe, especially in southern England, by the 2050s. These projections, made by combining crop and disease models for different climate change scenarios, suggest that improved control of fusarium ear blight should be a high priority in industry and government strategies for adaptation to climate change to ensure food security.},

abstract = {The incidence, severity and yield loss caused by 41 pathogens were assessed from a survey of 18 wheat pathologists covering the wheat-growing areas of Australia. The survey provided data on the frequency of years that each pathogen developed to its maximum extent, the proportion of the crop then affected in each growing area, and the yield loss that resulted in the affected crops with and without current control measures. These data were combined with crop production and quality data to estimate the value of the losses aggregated to the Northern, Southern and Western production regions. Pathogens were estimated to cause a current average loss of {\$}913 x 10(6)/year or 19.5{\%} of the average annual value of the wheat crop in the decade from 1998-99 to 2007-08. Nationally, the three most important pathogens were Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, Puccinia struformis and Phaeosphaeria nodorum with current average annual losses of {\$}212 x 10(6), {\$}127 x 10(6) and {\$}108 x 10(6), respectively. If current controls were not used, losses would be far higher with potential average annual losses from the three most important pathogens, P. struformis, P. triticirepentis and Heterodera avenae, being {\$}994 x 10(6), {\$}676 x 10(6) and {\$}572 x 10(6), respectively. The average value of control practices exceeded {\$}100 x 10(6)/year for 12 pathogens. Cultural methods (rotation, paddock preparation) were the only controls used for 10 pathogens and contributed more than 50{\%} of the control for a further eight pathogens. Breeding and the use of resistant cultivars contributed more than 50{\%} of control for seven pathogens and pesticides for three pathogens. The relative importance of pathogens varied between regions and zones.},

The Foc tropical race 4 (TR4) is currently known as a major concern in global banana production. No effective resistance is known in Musa to Foc, and no effective measures for controlling Foc once banana plants have been infected in place. Early and accurate detection of Foc TR4 is essential to protect banana industry and guide banana planting. A real-time fluorescence loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (RealAmp) was developed for the rapid and quantitative detection of Foc TR4 in soil. The detection limit of the RealAmp assay was approximately 0.4 pg/µl plasmid DNA when mixed with extracted soil DNA or 10(3) spores/g of artificial infested soil, and no cross-reaction with other relative pathogens were observed. The RealAmp assay for quantifying genomic DNA of TR4 was confirmed by testing both artificially and naturally infested samples. Quantification of the soil-borne pathogen DNA of Foc TR4 in naturally infested samples was no significant difference compared to classic real-time PCR (P{\textgreater}0.05). Additionally, RealAmp assay was visual with an improved closed-tube visual detection system by adding SYBR Green I fluorescent dye to the inside of the lid prior to amplification, which avoided the inhibitory effects of the stain on DNA amplification and makes the assay more convenient in the field and could thus become a simple, rapid and effective technique that has potential as an alternative tool for the detection and monitoring of Foc TR4 in field, which would be a routine DNA-based testing service for the soil-borne pathogen in South China.},

Previous research has focused on optimising the factors affecting reliable multiplex PCR, including primer design, PCR components and conditions, and inhibitors in samples. In this study, the interaction of primers to form complex secondary structures including visible dimers and invisible "primer clusters", a novel form of primer secondary structure found during this research, were shown to be the most important factors affecting successful multiplex PCR. Approaches to mitigate primer interaction and eliminate inhibitors were tested, including: reduction of primer concentrations especially those with preferential amplification; decrease of PCR extension temperature; increase of extension time and PCR cycles; and addition of bovine serum albumin. Based on these approaches, a multiplex RT-PCR with sensitivity comparable to the simplex PCR for individual viruses was developed for the detection of Raspberry ringspot virus, Strawberry latent ringspot virus and Tomato bushy stunt virus. A plant internal amplification control was also included. These approaches may be useful as a guideline for the development of multiplex PCR protocols for the detection of other pathogens or organisms associated with plants, humans, animals and the environment. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Together with F. proliferatum, F. culmorum, and F. graminearum (teleomorph: Gibberella zeae) they are involved in the stalk rot and ear rot disease of maize. All species produce secondary metabolites (mycotoxins) which are a potential health hazard for humans and animals that consume maize and maize products frequently. In this study the development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for an easy and sensitive identification of G. fujikuroi anamorphs in maize kernels are described. The primer pairs are based on sequences of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fragments and are specific for F. moniliforme and F. subglutinans, respectively. The PCR assays are independent of the high phenotypic variability of traits which may complicate classification by morphological characters. They detect approximately 100 to 200 fungal genomes in the presence of an excess of maize DNA. For the analysis of infected maize kernels a rapid and easy DNA extraction was used which does not introduce inhibitory substances into the PCR. Hence, the assays enable an early identification and detection of the two pathogens in host tissue by plant breeders and plant health inspection services.

abstract = {Spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. TRISO) was grown for three consecutive seasons in a free-air carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment (FACE) field experiment in order to examine the effects on crop yield and grain quality. CO2 enrichment promoted aboveground biomass (+11.8{\%}) and grain yield (+10.4{\%}). However, adverse effects were predominantly observed on wholegrain quality characteristics. Although the thousand-grain weight remained unchanged, size distribution was significantly shifted towards smaller grains, which may directly relate to lower market value. Total grain protein concentration decreased significantly by 7.4{\%} under elevated CO2, and protein and amino acid composition were altered. Corresponding to the decline in grain protein concentration, CO2 enrichment resulted in an overall decrease in amino acid concentrations, with greater reductions in non-essential than essential amino acids. Minerals such as potassium, molybdenum and lead increased, while manganese, iron, cadmium and silicon decreased, suggesting that adjustments of agricultural practices may be required to retain current grain quality standards. The concentration of fructose and fructan, as well as amounts per area of total and individual non-structural carbohydrates, except for starch, significantly increased in the grain. The same holds true for the amount of lipids. With regard to mixing and rheological properties of the flour, a significant increase in gluten resistance under elevated CO2 was observed. CO2 enrichment obviously affected grain quality characteristics that are important for consumer nutrition and health, and for industrial processing and marketing, which have to date received little attention.},

abstract = {Plant pathogenic fungi of the genus Fusarium cause agriculturally important diseases of small grain cereals and maize. Trichothecenes are a class of mycotoxins produced by different Fusarium species that inhibit eukaryotic protein biosynthesis and presumably interfere with the expression of genes induced during the defense response of the plants. One of its members, deoxynivalenol, most likely acts as a virulence factor during fungal pathogenesis and frequently accumulates in grain to levels posing a threat to human and animal health. We report the isolation and characterization of a gene from Arabidopsis thaliana encoding a UDP-glycosyltransferase that is able to detoxify deoxynivalenol. The enzyme, previously assigned the identifier UGT73C5, catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to the hydroxyl group at carbon 3 of deoxynivalenol. Using a wheat germ extract-coupled transcription/ translation system we have shown that this enzymatic reaction inactivates the mycotoxin. This deoxynivalenol-glucosyltransferase (DOGT1) was also found to detoxify the acetylated derivative 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol, whereas no protective activity was observed against the structurally similar nivalenol. Expression of the glucosyltransferase is developmentally regulated and induced by deoxynivalenol as well as salicylic acid, ethylene, and jasmonic acid. Constitutive overexpression in Arabidopsis leads to enhanced tolerance against deoxynivalenol.},

abstract = {The cytotoxicity of the de-epoxy metabolites of trichothecenes nivalenol (NIV) and deoxynivalenol (DON) was determined and compared with the cytotoxicity of the respective toxin with an intact epoxy group and their acetylated derivatives. The cytotoxic effects was determined by using the 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay assessing DNA-synthesis. The toxicity of NIV and DON expressed as the concentration inhibiting 50{\%} of the DNA synthesis (IC50), was occurring at similar micromolar concentrations (1.19 +/- 0.06 and 1.50 +/- 0.34 muM). The toxicity of fusarenon X (4-acetyl NIV) in the assay was similar to the toxicity of NIV, and the toxicity of 15-AcDON was equal to the toxicity of DON. 3-AcDON was less toxic than DON and 15-AcDON. The IC50 value for de-epoxy DON was 54 times higher in the assay than the IC50 for DON, while the IC50 of de-epoxy NIV was 55 times higher than the IC50 for NIV. The results verify previous findings that the de-epoxidation is a detoxification reaction. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Glasshouse studies were undertaken to determine if fungicides used for the control of Fusarium head blight (FHB) result in elevated concentrations of the trichothecene mycotoxin, deoxynivalenol (DON) in harvested wheat grain. Metconazole and azoxystrobin, at double, full, half or quarter the manufacturer's recommended dose rate, were applied to ears of wheat (cv. Cadenza), artificially inoculated with conidia of either Fusarium culmorum or F. graminearum. Metconazole demonstrated high activity against both pathogens, reducing significantly the severity of FHB and the DON concentrations at each of the four dose rates tested when compared to untreated controls. Applications of azoxystrobin significantly reduced FHB and DON compared to unsprayed controls. However, their effectiveness was significantly less than that of metconazole and no dose rate response was observed. Quantification of the amount of trichothecene-producing Fusarium present in harvested grain was determined using a competitive PCR assay based on primers derived from the trichodiene synthase gene (Tri5). Simple linear regression analyses revealed strong relationships between the amount of trichothecene-producing Fusarium present in grain and the DON concentrations (r(2)=0.72-0.97). It is concluded that fungicides, applied for the control of FHB, affect DON concentrations indirectly by influencing the amount of trichothecene-producing Fusarium species present in wheat grain. There was no evidence that fungicide applications directly increase the concentration of DON in grain.},

abstract = {Fusarium species infect cereal crops worldwide and cause the important diseases Fusarium head blight and crown rot in wheat. Fusarium pathogens reduce yield and some species also produce trichothecene mycotoxins, such as deoxynivalenol (DON), during infection. These toxins play roles in pathogenesis on wheat and have serious health effects if present in grain consumed by humans or animals. In the present study, the response of wheat tissue to DON has been investigated. Infusion of wheat leaves with DON induced hydrogen peroxide production within 6 h followed by cell death within 24 h that was accompanied by DNA laddering, a hallmark of programmed cell death. In addition, real-time PCR analysis revealed that DON treatment rapidly induced transcription of a number of defence genes in a concentration-dependent manner. Co-treatment with DON and the antioxidant ascorbic acid reduced these responses, suggesting their induction may be at least partially mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), commonly known to be signalling molecules in plants. Wheat defence genes were more highly expressed in wheat stems inoculated with a DON-producing fungal strain than those inoculated with a DON-non-producing mutant, but only at a late stage of infection. Taken together, the results are consistent with a model in which DON production during infection of wheat induces ROS, which on the one hand may stimulate programmed host cell death assisting necrotrophic fungal growth, whereas, on the other hand, the ROS may contribute to the induction of antimicrobial host defences.},

abstract = {Future atmospheric CO2 concentrations are predicted to increase, and directly affect host plant phenology, which, in turn, is assumed to mediate the performance of herbivorous insects indirectly as well as the abundance and epidemiology of plant diseases. In a 4-year field experiment, spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Triso) and spring oilseed rape (Brassica napus L. cv. Campino) were grown using a mini-free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) system, which consisted of a control (CON), an ambient treatment (AMB) and FACE treatments. The CON and AMB treatments did not receive additional CO2, whereas the FACE plots were moderately elevated by 150 mu LL-1 CO2. The impact of elevated CO2 was examined with regard to plant phenology, biomass, leaf nitrogen and carbon, abundance of insect pest species and their relative population growth by either direct counts or yellow sticky traps. Occurrence and damage of plants by pathogens on spring wheat and oilseed rape were directly assessed. Disease infestations on plants were not significantly different between ambient and elevated CO2 in any of the years. Plant phenology, aboveground biomass, foliar nitrogen and carbon concentrations were also not significantly affected by CO2 enrichment. In contrast, the abundance of some species of insects was significantly influenced by elevated CO2, showing either an increase or a decrease in infestation intensity.},

abstract = {To establish the identity of Fusarium species associated with head blight (FHB) and crown rot (CR) of wheat, samples were collected from wheat paddocks with different cropping history in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales during 2001. CR was more widespread but FHB was only evident in northern NSW and often occurred with CR in the same paddock. Twenty different Fusarium spp. were identified from monoconidial isolates originating from different plant parts by using morphology and species-specific PCR assays. Fusarium pseudograminearum constituted 48{\%} of all isolates and was more frequently obtained from the crown, whereas Fusarium graminearum made up 28{\%} of all isolates and came mostly from the head. All 17 Fusarium species tested caused FHB and all 10 tested caused CR in plant infection assays, with significant (P {\textless} 0.001) difference in aggressiveness among species and among isolates within species for both diseases. Overall, isolates from stubble and crown were more aggressive for CR, whereas isolates from the flag leaf node were more aggressive for FHB. Isolates that were highly aggressive in causing CR were those originating from paddocks with wheat following wheat, whereas those from fields with wheat following maize or sorghum were highly aggressive for FHB. Although 20{\%} of isolates caused severe to highly severe FHB and CR, there was no significant (P {\textless} 0.32) correlation between aggressiveness for FHB and CR. Given the ability of F. graminearum to colonise crowns in the field and to cause severe CR in bioassays, it is unclear why this pathogen is not more widely distributed in Australia.},

abstract = {Barley (Hordeum vulgare) was grown in different climatic environments with elevated [CO2] (700 vs 385 ppm), [O3] (60/90 vs 20 ppb) and temperature (24/19 vs 19/12°C day/night) as single factors and in combinations, to evaluate the impact of these climatic factors on photosynthesis and susceptibility to powdery mildew and spot blotch disease. No significant increase in net CO2 assimilation rate was observed in barley grown under elevated [CO2] at ambient temperature. However, this rate was positively stimulated under elevated temperature together with a slightly higher potential quantum efficiency of PSII, both at ambient and elevated [CO2], suggesting that photosynthesis was not limited by [CO2] at ambient temperature. When growing under elevated temperature or [O3], infection by the biotrophic powdery mildew fungus decreased, whereas disease symptoms and growth of the toxin-secreting hemibiotrophic spot blotch fungus increased compared to ambient conditions, implying that climate-induced changes in disease severity could be linked to the trophic lifestyle of the pathogens. Elevated [CO2] decreased powdery mildew infection but had no effect on spot blotch disease compared to ambient condition. However, the effect of elevated [CO2], [O3] and temperature did not act in an additive manner when combined. This led to a surprising disease development in the combination treatments, where powdery mildew infection increased despite the individual reducing effect of the climatic factors, and spot blotch disease decreased despite the individual promoting effect of temperature and ozone, emphasizing the importance of conducting multifactorial experiments when evaluating the potential effects of climate change.},

abstract = {Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), the causal agent of Fusarium wilt or Panama disease on banana, is one of the major constraints in banana production worldwide. Indonesia is the centre of origin for wild and cultivated bananas, which likely co-evolved with Foc. This study explored the widest possible genetic diversity of Foc by sampling across Indonesia at 34 geographically and environmentally different locations in 15 provinces at six islands. This resulted in a comprehensive collection of ∼200 isolates from 40 different local banana varieties. Isolates were identified and assessed using sequence analysis of the translation elongation factor-1alpha (tef1), the RNA polymerase II largest subunit (rpb1), and the RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (rpb2). Phylogenetic analyses of these genes allowed the identification of 180 isolates of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), and 20 isolates of the Fusarium fujikuroi species complex (FFSC), the Fusarium incarnatum-equiseti species complex (FIESC), and the Fusarium sambucinum species complex (FSSC). Further analyses, incorporating a worldwide collection of Foc strains, revealed nine independent genetic lineages for Foc, and one novel clade in the Fusarium oxysporum species complex (FOSC). Selected isolates from each lineage were tested on the banana varieties Gros Michel and Cavendish to characterise their pathogenicity profiles. More than 65 {\%} of the isolates were diagnosed as Tropical Race 4 (Foc-TR4) due to their pathogenicity to Cavendish banana, which supports the hypothesis that Foc-TR4 is of Indonesian origin. Nine independent genetic lineages for Foc are formally described in this study. This biodiversity has not been studied since the initial description of Foc in 1919. This study provides a detailed overview of the complexity of Fusarium wilt on banana and its diversity and distribution across Indonesia.},

abstract = {The effect of N availability on photosynthetic capacity, growth parameters and yield was studied in field-grown durum-wheat plants at both the leaf and canopy levels. Two contrasting nitrogen levels (120 and 0 kg ha(-1)) were assayed in a randomised block design with nine replicates each. Total biomass was measured at anthesis and yield and its agronomical components at maturity. Photosynthetic measurements were performed 2 weeks after anthesis in two plots of each N treatment. Flag leaves were measured, using a LI-COR 6400 combined with the chlorophyll fluorescence meter, and the whole canopy by measuring CO2 and H2O fluxes in an innovative canopy-chamber system. We showed a clear increase in photosynthetic gas exchange and chlorophyll contents with N fertilisation at both canopy and leaf levels. As a consequence the increase in yield as response to N fertilisation seems the result of a larger green leaf area combined with a higher photosynthetic capacity of the leaves attributable to an increase in the maximum carboxylation velocity of Rubisco. Moreover gas-exchange measurements of the flag leaf during grain filling seem to provide a realistic characterisation, not just of the photosynthetic performance of the crop, but also about the impact of N availability oil yield. Thus, measurements performed on the flag leaf matched those at the canopy level, with proportional increases in terms of gas exchange and chlorophyll content, providing a fast, cheap and reliable estimation of canopy photosynthesis and the grain yield attained by the crop.

abstract = {This paper examines the available information on the potential for climate-change impacts on mycotoxigenic fungi and mycotoxin contamination of food crops pre- and postharvest. It considers the effect of changes in temperature/water availability on mycotoxin contamination, especially incidences where aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A production has been influenced. The potential of using preharvest models to predict risk from deoxynivalenol (DON) in wheat, fumonisin B1 in maize and aflatoxins in maize and peanuts in different continents are considered in the context of potential for adaptation to include climate-change scenarios. Available information suggests that slightly elevated CO2 concentrations and interactions with temperature and water availability may stimulate growth of some mycotoxigenic species, especially under water stress. The accumulated knowledge on interacting conditions of water/temperature effects on optimum and boundary conditions for growth and mycotoxin production has been used to predict the effects that +3 and +5°C increases under water stress would have on growth/mycotoxin production by mycotoxigenic species. Various spatial scales, from toxin gene expression to regional approaches using geostatistics, are examined for their use in understanding the impact that climate change may have on food contamination in developing and developed countries. The potential for using an integrated systems approach to link gene expression data, phenotypic toxin production under different interacting abiotic conditions is discussed using Fusarium species and DON as examples. Such approaches may be beneficial for more accurate predictions of risk from mycotoxins on a regional basis and also the potential for new emerging toxin threats.},

abstract = {The present investigation was carried out in a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) facility to assess the effect of elevated CO2 on the incidence and severity of three foliar diseases of Brassica juncea cv. Pusa Tarak. Exposure of plants to elevated concentration of CO2 (550 ppm) revealed lower incidence and severity of Alternaria blight caused by Alternaria brassicae and downy mildew caused by Hyaloperonospora brassicae, while white rust infection caused by Albugo candida increased. Leaves of mustard plants grown under elevated CO2 had a higher amount of epicuticular wax which, together with higher concentration of total phenols and phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity, may have increased the ability of mustard plants to resist infection by A. brassicae and H. brassicae. Mustard plants grown under elevated CO2 showed a decrease in stomatal density and pore size, and consequently also in stomatal conductance. This might explain the decrease in disease index of downy mildew caused by the stomata-invading pathogen H. brassicae. There was no change in leaf protein concentration, whereas sugars were three times as concentrated in plants grown under high vs. ambient CO2. There was an increase in the concentration of total glucosinolates (GSs) under FACE in plants grown under elevated CO2, but a decrease in their diversity. Namely, the aliphatic GS gluconapin was more abundant in plants grown under high CO2, while three out of eight different GSs found in the leaves of plants grown under ambient CO2 could not be detected. Higher sugar availability and lower GSs diversity may account for the higher incidence and severity of white rust caused by the obligate biotroph A. candida.},

abstract = {Pests and diseases impact on crop yield and quality, and also reduce resource-use efficiency. Improved crop protection strategies to prevent such damage and loss can increase production and make a substantial contribution to food security. DNA-based technologies are likely to greatly increase the speed, sensitivity and accuracy of pest and pathogen detection and diagnosis. Rapid sequencing of nucleic acids from infected plants will aid identification of novel disease agents. Biomarkers of disease or crop damage such as volatile chemicals or blends may also be used to detect pest outbreaks. Biosensors coupled to information networks will provide real-time monitoring and surveillance of crops or stored produce and hence early warning of emerging problems and new invasive species. Challenges remain in the dissemination of new technologies and information to resource poor farmers in developing countries, although the rapid extension of the internet, mobile phones and other communication networks will provide new opportunities. Defining the genetic and molecular basis of innate plant immunity has been a major advance in plant biology with the potential to identify new targets for intervention via novel chemistry or genetic modification (GM). Identification of regulatory genes, signal molecules, pathways and networks controlling induced plant defence should lead to the development of a new generation of defence modulators, delivered either as crop protection products, or via biological agents on seeds or in the root zone. There should also be opportunities to select more responsive crop genotypes, or to develop transgenic crops tailored to respond to specific chemical cues or molecular patterns diagnostic for particular biotic threats. Sequencing of the genomes of the major crop species and their wild relatives will expand enormously the known gene pool and diversity of genetic resources available for plant breeders to access. It should be possible to identify genomic regions and genes conferring more durable, quantitative resistance to pathogens. The breeding cycle will be accelerated by high-throughput phenotyping and more efficient selection of resistance traits using within-gene markers. GM approaches will facilitate pyramiding (combining) resistance genes with different specificities and modes of action, thereby reducing the risk of directional selection for virulence. Analysis of the genomes of plant pathogens and invertebrate pests is already providing new information on genes, gene families and processes involved in host colonization and pathogenicity. Comparative genomics of species with diverse host ranges, contrasting feeding habits and different pathogenic lifestyles will identify new targets for inhibiting pest attack and aid the development of novel antimicrobial drugs and pesticides. Understanding the natural ecology of pests and pathogens, such as the factors determining host location, resource exploitation and interactions with other organisms, will improve our ability to manipulate behaviour, or exploit natural enemies or other antagonists of pest species. Volatile signals, either from natural plant sources, or engineered in transgenic crops, will be more widely used to modify pest behaviour. It may also be possible to manipulate microbial communities regulating pathogen populations and activity, and thereby recruit and retain more effective biocontrol agents. Insights into the natural diversity and activity of soil and microbial populations in the zones surrounding roots and seeds will provide new information on mechanism of suppression regulating pest species. Fully effective interventions are unlikely, due to the complexity and diversity of the soil system, but there should be progress towards integrated control regimes combining more resistant crop genotypes (either selected or GM) with targeted management of natural suppressive processes. Harnessing new technologies and knowledge to create more durable resistant crops and sustainable disease and pest management systems will require improved understanding of the factors driving pest and pathogen adaptation and evolution. There must also be an increased emphasis on translational research and delivery, and developing strategies appropriate for lower-input production systems, if the second 'green revolution' is to become a reality.},

abstract = {A spatiotemporal model has been developed to simulate the spread of anthracnose, initiated by infected seed, in a lupin field. The model quantifies the loss of healthy growing points of lupin in all 1-m2 subunits of a field throughout a growing season. The development of growing points is modeled as a function of temperature using a 1-day time step, and disease-induced compensatory growth is accounted for. Dispersal of spores is simulated explicitly using Monte Carlo techniques. Spread of spores occurs during rainfall events on a 1-h time step. The distance traveled by spores is partially dependent on wind speed and is generated by adding the values selected from half-Cauchy distributions. The direction of travel of the spores is influenced by wind direction. The model has been employed to produce a theoretical assessment of damage from disease in two environments at five levels of seed infection. It was calculated that in a susceptible lupin cultivar with a 0.01{\%} initial seed infection, anthracnose would cause approximately 15{\%} loss of healthy growing points in a high rainfall environment in Western Australia. In a low rainfall environment, similar damage would be unlikely even with a much higher (1{\%}) level of seed infection.},

Verification of predictions is a major difficulty; the most convincing method would be to " back-forecast " observed historical changes.

abstract = {The effect of previous crops (oilseed, legume, and cereal) on the incidence and severity of crown rot ( Fusarium pseudograminearum, Fp) and yield of wheat was investigated in 3 field studies in northern New South Wales. The experiments were designed to compare the effectiveness of the Brassica break crops canola ( Brassica napus L.) and mustard ( B. juncea L.) with chickpea ( Cicer arietinum L.) on reduction of Fp in subsequent wheat crops. Responses to previous broadleaf and cereal crops were investigated in Fp-tolerant bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) and Fp-susceptible durum wheat [ Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum (Dest.)]. In all experiments, broadleaf break crops increased the yield of Fp-susceptible durum wheat compared with durum after cereals ( by 0.24 - 0.89 t/ha). The same response was observed for the Fp-tolerant wheat at 2 of the 3 sites (0.71 and 0.78 t/ha), with a lower yield (0.13 t/ha) after break crops than after cereals at one site during a drought. The yield of the Fp-susceptible durum wheat was generally higher after brassicas than after chickpea ( yield advantage 0.27 - 0.58 t/ha), whereas there was no such difference in the tolerant wheat variety. In most cases, these yield responses to the previous crops were closely related to the severity of Fp infection. Overall yield of susceptible durum wheat was reduced by 1{\%} for each 1{\%} increase in Fp severity at harvest. Residual water and nitrogen (N) did not explain responses to previous crops, although common root rot ( Bipolaris sorokiniana) may have contributed to some of the responses at the sites. There was little evidence that the lower disease and higher yield following brassicas compared with chickpea was related to suppression of Fp by biofumigation. More plausible explanations are that residual cereal residues decomposed more rapidly under dense Brassica canopies thus reducing Fp inoculum, that Fp severity was increased following chickpea due to higher soil N status, or that brassicas resulted in soil/residue biology that was less conducive to Fp inoculum survival. Evidence for the latter was provided by consistently higher levels of Trichoderma spp. isolated from wheat following brassicas compared with chickpea or cereals. Irrespective of the mechanisms involved, the results demonstrate that Brassica oilseeds provide an effective break crop for crown rot in northern NSW. Furthermore, brassicas may provide an excellent alternative rotation crop to chickpea for high value durum wheat due to an apparent capacity to more effectively reduce the severity of crown rot infection in subsequent crops.},

abstract = {Crop pathogens and pests reduce the yield and quality of agricultural production. They cause substantial economic losses and reduce food security at household, national and global levels. Quantitative, standardized information on crop losses is difficult to compile and compare across crops, agroecosystems and regions. Here, we report on an expert-based assessment of crop health, and provide numerical estimates of yield losses on an individual pathogen and pest basis for five major crops globally and in food security hotspots. Our results document losses associated with 137 pathogens and pests associated with wheat, rice, maize, potato and soybean worldwide. Our yield loss (range) estimates at a global level and per hotspot for wheat (21.5{\%} (10.1–28.1{\%})), rice (30.0{\%} (24.6–40.9{\%})), maize (22.5{\%} (19.5–41.1{\%})), potato (17.2{\%} (8.1–21.0{\%})) and soybean (21.4{\%} (11.0–32.4{\%})) suggest that the highest losses are associated with food-deficit regions with fast-growing populations, and frequently with emerging or re-emerging pests and diseases. Our assessment highlights differences in impacts among crop pathogens and pests and among food security hotspots. This analysis contributes critical information to prioritize crop health management to improve the sustainability of agroecosystems in delivering services to societies.},

abstract = {Crown rot (CR), caused by various Fusarium species, is a chronic wheat disease in Australia. As part of our objective of improving the efficiency of breeding CR resistant wheat varieties, we have been searching for novel sources of resistance. This paper reports on the genetic control of one of these newly identified resistant genotypes, 'CSCR6'. A population derived from a cross between CSCR6 and an Australian variety 'Lang' was analyzed using two Fusarium isolates belonging to two different species, one Fusarium pseudograminearum and the other Fusarium graminearum. The two isolates detected QTL with the same chromosomal locations and comparable magnitudes, indicating that CR resistance is not species-specific. The resistant allele of one of the QTL was derived from 'CSCR6'. This QTL, designated as Qcrs.cpi-3B, was located on the long arm of chromosome 3B and explains up to 48.8{\%} of the phenotypic variance based on interval mapping analysis. Another QTL, with resistant allele from the variety 'Lang', was located on chromosome 4B. This QTL explained up to 22.8{\%} of the phenotypic variance. A strong interaction between Qcsr.cpi-3B and Qcsr.cpi-4B was detected, reducing the maximum effect of Qcrs.cpi-3B to 43.1{\%}. The effects of Qcrs.cpi-3B were further validated in four additional populations and the presence of this single QTL reduced CR severity by up to 42.1{\%}. The fact that significant effects of Qcrs.cpi-3B were detected across all trials with different genetic backgrounds and with the use of isolates belonging to two different Fusarium species make it an ideal target for breeding programs as well as for further characterization of the gene(s) involved in its resistance.},

abstract = {A vast number of plant pathogens from viroids of a few hundred nucleotides to higher plants cause diseases in our crops. Their effects range from mild symptoms to catastrophes in which large areas planted to food crops are destroyed. Catastrophic plant disease exacerbates the current deficit of food supply in which at least 800 million people are inadequately fed. Plant pathogens are difficult to control because their populations are variable in time, space, and genotype. Most insidiously, they evolve, often overcoming the resistance that may have been the hard-won achievement of the plant breeder. In order to combat the losses they cause, it is necessary to define the problem and seek remedies. At the biological level, the requirements are for the speedy and accurate identification of the causal organism, accurate estimates of the severity of disease and its effect on yield, and identification of its virulence mechanisms. Disease may then be minimized by the reduction of the pathogen's inoculum, inhibition of its virulence mechanisms, and promotion of genetic diversity in the crop. Conventional plant breeding for resistance has an important role to play that can now be facilitated by marker-assisted selection. There is also a role for transgenic modification with genes that confer resistance. At the political level, there is a need to acknowledge that plant diseases threaten our food supplies and to devote adequate resources to their control.},

abstract = {Although there was no difference in the percentage of powdery mildew conidia that germinated on the second leaf of barley plants grown in either 350 or 700 ppm CO2, the percentage of conidia that progressed to produce colonies was lower in plants grown in 700 than in 350 ppm CO2. The lower percentage of conidia producing hyphae in 700 ppm CO2 was due to a higher proportion of the spores being arrested at the appressorial stage. The reduction in penetration of spores in 700 ppm CO2 was due neither to 700 ppm CO2 per se, nor to ontogenetic changes in the host tissue. Removing the epicuticular waxes from the surface of the leaf had no effect on the development of conidia on the surface of leaves in 350 or 700 ppm CO2, showing that increased epicuticular waxes were not causing the increased resistance to primary penetration of powdery mildew in 700 ppm CO2. We relate reduced rates of primary penetration in barley grown in 700 ppm CO2 to higher rates of net photosynthesis allowing increased mobilisation of resources into resistance including the production of papillae and accumulation of silicon at the sites of appressorial penetration. Established colonies of powdery mildew grew faster in 700 ppm CO2 than in 350 ppm CO2, coincident with accumulation of host carbohydrate in the source leaf.},

abstract = {A possible scenario for the end of the 21st century is that the atmospheric CO2 concentration will be in the range of 510-760 mu L L(-1) and that the mean global temperature will be 1.5-4.5 degrees C higher. Further, there may be greater incidences of extreme climatic events, which together with the CO2 and temperature changes will influence development, growth and grain yield of cereals such as rice and wheat. For these C-3, plants, the driving force for the growth response to elevated CO2 is higher leaf CO2 assimilation rates (4). However, the response of A to CO2 depends on temperature with maximum absolute increases occuring at temperatures which do not cause flower abortion, while negligible increases are observed at low temperatures. At high temperatures, where A is reduced because of partial inactivation of photosynthetic enzymes, the increase in A due to CO2 enrichment is still observed. Other factors, such as changes in shoot water relations or hormone concentrations, may influence growth at elevated CO2 concentrations. Wheat and rice development is accelerated by high temperature and consequently grain yield is reduced because there is less time for radiation to be intercepted during the vegetative phase. Although high CO2 also accelerates development in rice and, to a lesser extent in wheat, the extra carbohydrate produced by increases in A results in at least a 40{\%} increase in grain yield at temperatures which do not cause flower abortion. This is due mainly to increased tiller numbers rather than increases in the number or weight of individual grains. However, the yield enhancement due to high CO2 will not necessarily compensate for decreases in yield caused by accelerated development at high temperatures. As predicted by the response of A to high CO2, the relative increase in yield, due to rising CO2 concentrations, is smaller at lower temperatures. Elevated atmospheric CO2 may improve the tolerance of plants to heat-induced drought stress by facilitating the maintenance of cell volume and photosynthetic function in the leaves. Increased carbohydrate storage in the stems may also be an advantage during grain filling if the flag leaves senesce prematurely. However, it is unlikely that the effect of very high temperatures on newer abortion will be ameliorated by high CO2. For bread making, the quality of flour produced from grain developed at high temperatures is poorer. High CO2 may also have an effect through a reduction in the protein content of wheat grain. For rice, the amylose content of the grain, a major determinant of cooking quality is increased under elevated CO2.},

However, continued exposure of the developmental stages to phosphine, recorded maximum LC values in the pupae followed by egg and the larval instars. A linear increase in the mortality response was witnessed in all the insect stages when the exposure periods were extended from 24 to 168 h with increasing concentrations of phosphine, conversely significant increase in mortality was greatly appar-ent during the initial treatment periods.},

We describe the agronomic practices, ecological scenarios, and genomic attributes that can result in the disruption of symbiosis, and highlight new work probing its molecular basis.

abstract = {The effect of elevated CO2 concentrations on the levels of secondary metabolites was investigated in tobacco plants grown under two nitrogen supply (5 and 8 mm NH4NO3) and CO2 conditions (350 and 1000 p.p.m.) each. High CO2 resulted in a dramatic increase of phenylpropanoids in the leaves, including the major carbon-rich compound chlorogenic acid (CGA) and the coumarins scopolin and scopoletin at both nitrogen fertilizations. This was accompanied by increased PAL activity in leaves and roots, which was even higher at the lower nitrogen supply. Hardly any change was observed for the structural phenolic polymer lignin and the sesquiterpenoid capsidiol. In contrast, elevated CO2 led to clearly decreased levels of the main nitrogen-rich constituent nicotine at the lower N-supply (5 mm NH4NO3) but not when plants were grown at the higher N-supply (8 mm NH4NO3). Inoculation experiments with potato virus Y (PVY) were used to evaluate possible ecological consequences of elevated CO2. The titre of viral coat-protein was markedly reduced in leaves under these conditions at both nitrogen levels. Since PR-gene expression and free salicylic acid (SA) levels remained unchanged at elevated CO2, we suggest that the accumulation of phenylpropanoids, for example, the major compound CGA and the coumarins scopolin and scopoletin may result in an earlier confinement of the virus at high CO2. Based on our results two final conclusions emerge. First, elevated CO2 leads to a shift in secondary metabolite composition that is dependent on the availability of nitrogen. Second, changes in the pool of secondary metabolites have important consequences for plant-pathogen interactions as shown for PVY as a test organism.},

Vegetative compatibility of the isolates was assessed through complementation tests using nitrate non-utilizing mutants.

We review knowledge of relationships between climate variables and several forest diseases, as well as current evidence of how climate, host and pathogen interactions are responding or might respond to climate change. Many forests can be managed to both adapt to climate change and minimize the undesirable effects of expected increases in tree mortality. We discuss four types of forest and disease management tactics – monitoring, forecasting, planning and mitigation – and provide case studies of yellow-cedar decline and sudden aspen decline to illustrate how forest diseases might be managed in the face of climate change. The uncertainties inherent to climate change effects can be diminished by conducting research, assessing risks, and linking results to forest policy, planning and decision making.},

abstract = {Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L cv. Yitpi and cv. Janz) was grown under field conditions in the Australian Grains Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (AGFACE) facility. Ambient [CO2] (a[CO2], similar to 384 mu mol mol(-1)) and elevated [CO2] (e[CO2], similar to 550 mu mol mol(-1)) were combined with two soil water levels (rain-fed and irrigated) and two times of sowing (TOS) in three consecutive years to provide six environments (2007-TOS1, 2007-TOS2, 2008-TOS1, 2008-TOS2, 2009-TOS1, 2009-TOS2). Grain samples were assessed for a range of physical, nutritional and dough rheological properties. The effect of e[CO2] on thousand grain weight (TGW) was significantly different in each growing environment: TGW was significantly increased under e[CO2] only at 2007-TOS2 (by 5{\%}), 2009-TOS1 (by 5{\%}) and 2009-TOS2 (by 15{\%}) but not significantly changed under other conditions. The magnitude of reduction of grain protein concentration at e[CO2] differed among the growing environments but was highly correlated with the percentage yield stimulation under e[CO2] (r(2) = 0.91) suggesting that grain protein concentration under e[CO2] was diluted by increased yield. Across all treatments, grain nutrient concentration was significantly reduced by e[CO2] for Fe (3.9{\%}, 6.2{\%}), Cu (2.2{\%}, 3.4{\%}), Zn (5.9{\%}, 5.7{\%}), Ca (5.6{\%}, 7.3{\%}), Mg (5.6{\%}, 5.8{\%}), Na (21.2{\%}, 30.4{\%}), S (4.4{\%}, 4.4{\%}), P (4.1{\%}, 3.2{\%}) in cv. Yitpi and Janz, respectively. Effects of e[CO2] on grain Zn, Mg and Na concentrations were dependent on the growing environment. Relative reduction of grain S, Fe, Mg, Zn, P at e[CO2] were significantly correlated with grain yield stimulation at e[CO2]. Reductions of these nutrients under e[CO2] were not fully explained by biomass dilution as the relationships differed for each nutrient. Under e[CO2], flour yield of cv. Janz was increased but that of cv. Yitpi was not changed. Even though grain protein concentrations of both cultivars were similar at e[CO2], bread volume as inferred indirectly by dough rheology parameters was 12{\%} greater for cv. Janz (185 +/- 5 cm(3)) than cv. Yitpi (162 +/- 4 cm(3)) at e[CO2]. This disparity may be related to the compositional changes in wheat flour protein at e[CO2], suggesting that future breeding and adaptation strategies to improve the grain quality under e[CO2] should consider the prevailing hydro-thermal conditions.

@article{Kazan2014a,
abstract = {The constant struggle between plants and microbes has driven the evolution of multiple defense strategies in the host as well as offense strategies in the pathogen. To defend themselves from pathogen attack, plants often rely on elaborate signaling networks regulated by phytohormones. In turn, pathogens have adopted innovative strategies to manipulate phytohormone-regulated defenses. Tactics frequently employed by plant pathogens involve hijacking, evading, or disrupting hormone signaling pathways and/or crosstalk. As reviewed here, this is achieved mechanistically via pathogen-derived molecules known as effectors, which target phytohormone receptors, transcriptional activators and repressors, and other components of phytohormone signaling in the host plant. Herbivores and sap-sucking insects employ obligate pathogens such as viruses, phytoplasma, or symbiotic bacteria to intervene with phytohormone-regulated defenses. Overall, an improved understanding of phytohormone intervention strategies employed by pests and pathogens during their interactions with plants will ultimately lead to the development of new crop protection strategies.},

abstract = {An isolate of the fungus Fusarium culmorum constitutively expressing green fluorescent protein was used to investigate the infection process and host response of primary seedling roots and stem base leaf sheaths of soft wheat cv. Genio. Disease progress was assessed macroscopically by visual symptoms, microscopically by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and via gene expression analysis of fungal and wheat genes by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. In the roots, CLSM investigations revealed an initial intercellular and subsequent intracellular colonization by fungal hyphae. The fungus invaded the rhizodermal layer and cortex but was not seen to colonize the stele. The fungus consistently expressed TRI5 (24, 48 and 96 h post-inoculation), indicating that trichothecenes were being synthesized throughout this phase of infection and colonization. The expression of the six host defence-associated genes (Wheatwin 1-2, PR1, Chitinase, PAL, WIR1 and LOX) increased early in infection and decreased during later stages. In the stem base, CLSM observations revealed the fungus sequentially penetrating though the first, second and third basal leaf sheaths. Expression of TRI5 was initiated early in the infection of each leaf sheath. The expression of the host defence-associated genes varied over time and across leaf sheaths, and all were also expressed in leaf sheaths which had not yet been in contact with the fungus. Expression of LOX and WIR1 were particularly enhanced in the third leaf sheath.},

@article{Dixon2012a,
abstract = {Climates are changing worldwide at rates not seen previously in geological time. This affects food production itself and the growth and reproduction of plant pathogens which reduce crop yield and quality. There is a need to develop an understanding of the implications and impacts of climate change on natural biodiversity, artificial landscapes as well as production agriculture (defined here as a generalization embracing all of the primary uses of land for agriculture, horticulture and forestry), since these form parts of an integrated continuum. Currently, 20-25{\%} of harvested crops worldwide are lost to pre- and post-harvest diseases and climatic change is expected to increase these losses. Climatic change results in increasing variability and altered scales of temperature, rainfall and wind velocity and periodicity. These changes affect the activities and vigour of aerial and soilborne pathogens. Some pathogens capable of devastating crops and harvested produce have become more active and damaging because their geographical ranges expand as a consequence of climate change. Human populations are increasing rapidly, resulting in greater demands on all natural resources which far outstrip supplies. Natural biodiversity is being damaged, frequently beyond repair and not infrequently with little or no knowledge of the characteristics of the plant genotypes being lost. Only very recently have analyses of ecosystem services begun revealing the intricate and delicate webs of unappreciated natural assets which are vital for human sustainable (used here to describe processes and actions which balance resource-use with resource-availability and conserve economic, environmental and social welfare) survival. The combination of climatic change, expanding human demands for food, resources and space and the increased activities of plant pathogens presents pathologists with immense challenges. Previously, visionary plant pathologists have contributed hugely to solving humanity's problems. Current challenges compounded by climate change offer opportunities for the exploitation of our profession's capacities for working with 'one foot in the furrow (and) one hand on the bench' with increasing relevance for society at large.},

Using log-linear regression and random-effects meta-analysis, we found that articles with a preprint had, on average, a 49{\%} higher Altmetric Attention Score and 36{\%} more citations than articles without a preprint. These associations were independent of several other article- and author-level variables (such as scientific subfield and number of authors), and were unrelated to journal-level variables such as access model and Impact Factor.

abstract = {Novel resistance to pathogens and pesticides is commonly associated with a fitness cost. However, measurements of the fitness costs of insecticide resistance have used diverse methods to control for genetic background and rarely assess the effects of environmental variation. Here, we explored how genetic background interacts with resource quality to affect the expression of the fitness costs associated with resistance. We used a serially backcrossed line of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, resistant to the biopesticide Bacillus thuringiensis, to estimate the costs of resistance for insects feeding on two Brassica species. We found that fitness costs increased on the better-defended Brassica oleracea cultivars. These data were included in two meta-analyses of fitness cost experiments that used standardized protocols (and a common resistant insect stock) but which varied in the methodology used to control for the effects of genetic background. The meta-analysis confirmed that fitness costs were higher on the low-quality host (B. oleracea); and experimental methodology did not influence estimates of fitness costs on that plant species. In contrast, fitness costs were heterogeneous in the Brassica pekinensis studies: fitness costs in genetically homogenized lines were significantly higher than in studies using revertant insects. We hypothesize that fitness modifiers can moderate fitness costs on high-quality plants but may not affect fitness when resource quality is low.},

This study investigated the relationship between number of ascospores of D. pinodes at sowing and disease intensity at crop maturity. Field pea stubble infested with ascochyta blight from one site was exposed to ambient conditions at two sites, repeated in 2 years. Three batches of stubble with varying degrees of infection were exposed at one site, repeated in 3 years. Every 2 weeks, stubble samples were retrieved, wetted and placed in a wind tunnel and up to 2500 ascospores g−1 h−1 were released. Secondary inoculum, monitored using seedling field peas as trap plants in canopies arising from three sowing dates and external to field pea canopies, was greatest in early sown crops. A model was developed to calculate the effective number of ascospores using predictions from G1 blackspot manager (Salam et al., 2011b; Australasian Plant Pathology, 40, 621–31), distance from infested stubble (Salam et al., 2011a; Australasian Plant Pathology, 40, 640–7) and winter rainfall. Maximum disease intensity was predicted based on the calculated number of effective ascospores, soilborne inoculum and spring rainfall over two seasons. Predictions were validated in the third season with data from field trials and commercial crops. A threshold amount of ascospores of D. pinodes, 294 g−1 stubble h−1, was identified, above which disease did not increase. Below this threshold there was a linear relationship between ascospore number and maximum disease intensity.},

abstract = {Abstract. Detailed field observations were made of the feeding behaviour of the polyphagous grasshopper Taeniopoda eques (Burmeister), in its desert habitat in the southwestern United States. Twelve adult females were observed continuously throughout the day, including three on overcast days and nine on sunny days. Insects observed on sunny days had two foraging periods, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, separated by an extended period of roosting. By contrast, those observed on overcast days had no extended midday roost and tended to feed intermittently throughout the day. Analysis of the patterns of feeding showed that feeding events were clustered into meals separated by inter-meal intervals of 8 min or longer. The insects almost always ascended a perch and took postprandial rests between meals. Those observed on sunny days locomoted less and spent a greater proportion of the inter-meal intervals quiescent, partly as a result of taking longer postprandial rests. The time spent feeding within meals was positively related to the amount of time spent locomoting in the preceding inter-meal interval (preprandial correlation), and negatively related to the time spent locomoting in the following inter-meal interval (postprandial correlation). A high degree of individual polyphagy was observed, with individual insects feeding on up to 30 food items per day and single meals consisting of feeds on up to 11 different food items. Increased food mixing was associated with increased locomotion. These patterns of feeding are compared with those previously observed in laboratory studies of insects.},

abstract = {The processes controlling the carbon flux and carbon storage of the atmosphere, ocean and terrestrial biosphere are temperature sensitive and are likely to provide a positive feedback leading to amplified anthropogenic warming. Owing to this feedback, at timescales ranging from interannual to the 20-100-kyr cycles of Earth's orbital variations, warming of the climate system causes a net release of CO2 into the atmosphere; this in turn amplifies warming. But the magnitude of the climate sensitivity of the global carbon cycle (termed $\gamma$), and thus of its positive feedback strength, is under debate, giving rise to large uncertainties in global warming projections. Here we quantify the median $\gamma$ as 7.7 p.p.m.v. CO2 per °C warming, with a likely range of 1.7-21.4 p.p.m.v. CO2 per °C. Sensitivity experiments exclude significant influence of pre-industrial land-use change on these estimates. Our results, based on the coupling of a probabilistic approach with an ensemble of proxy-based temperature reconstructions and pre-industrial CO2 data from three ice cores, provide robust constraints for $\gamma$ on the policy-relevant multi-decadal to centennial timescales. By using an ensemble of {\textgreater} 200,000 members, quantification of $\gamma$ is not only improved, but also likelihoods can be assigned, thereby providing a benchmark for future model simulations. Although uncertainties do not at present allow exclusion of $\gamma$ calculated from any of ten coupled carbon-climate models, we find that $\gamma$ is about twice as likely to fall in the lowermost than in the uppermost quartile of their range. Our results are incompatibly lower (P {\textless} 0.05) than recent pre-industrial empirical estimates of ∼40 p.p.m.v. CO2 per °C (refs 6, 7), and correspondingly suggest ∼80{\%} less potential amplification of ongoing global warming. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Photosynthetic activity of cereals has traditionally been studied using leaves, thus neglecting the role of other organs such as ears. Here, we studied the effects of water status and genotypes on the photosynthetic activity of the flag leaf blade and the ear of durum wheat. The various parameters related to the photosynthetic activity were analysed in relation to the total above-ground plant biomass and grain yield at maturity. Four local varieties plus two cultivars adapted to the semiarid areas of South Morocco were grown in pots in a greenhouse. Five different water treatments were maintained from the beginning of stem elongation to maturity, when shoot biomass and grain yield were recorded. The net photosynthesis (A), stomatal conductance (g(s)) and transpiration (T) of the ear and the flag leaf were measured at anthesis. In both organs these factors decreased significantly with water deficit, whereas the A/T and A/g(s) ratios increased. The genotype effect was also significant for all traits studied. Whole-organ photosynthesis was much higher in the ear than in the flag leaf in well-watered conditions. As water stress developed, photosynthesis decreased less in the ear than in the flag leaf. Whole-ear photosynthesis correlated better than flag leaf photosynthesis with biomass and yield. Nevertheless, the relationships of the whole flag leaf with biomass and yield improved as the water stress became more severe, suggesting a progressive shift of yield from sink to source limitation. For all water regimes the ratios A/g(s) and A/T of the ear also showed a higher ( negative) correlation with both biomass and yield than those of the flag leaf. The results indicate that the ear has a greater photosynthetic role than the flag leaf in determining grain yield, not only in drought but also in the absence of stress.},

abstract = {This article reports a lack of pathogenic specialization among Australian Fusarium graminearum and F pseudograminearum causing crown rot (CR) of wheat using analysis of variance (ANOVA), principal component and biplot analysis, Kendall's coefficient of concordance (W), and K statistics. Overall, E pseudograminearum was more aggressive than F graminearum, supporting earlier delineation of the crown-infecting group as a new species. Although significant wheat line-pathogen isolate interaction in ANOVA suggested putative specialization when seedlings of 60 wheat lines were inoculated with 4 pathogen isolates or 26 wheat lines were inoculated with 10 isolates, significant W and kappa showed agreement in rank order of wheat lines, indicating a lack of specialization. The first principal component representing nondifferential aggressiveness explained a large part (up to 65{\%}) of the variation in CR severity. The differential components were small and more pronounced in seedlings than in adult plants. By maximizing variance on the first two principal components, biplots were useful for highlighting the association between isolates and wheat lines. A key finding of this work is that a range of analytical tools are needed to explore pathogenic specialization, and a statistically significant interaction in an ANOVA cannot be taken as conclusive evidence of specialization. With no highly resistant wheat cultivars. Fusarium isolates mostly differ in aggressiveness; however, specialization may appear as more resistant cultivars become widespread.},

abstract = {The response of wheat crops to elevated CO2 (eCO2) was measured and modelled with the Australian Grains Free-Air CO2 Enrichment experiment, located at Horsham, Australia. Treatments included CO2 by water, N and temperature. The location represents a semi-arid environment with a seasonal VPD of around 0.5 kPa. Over three years the observed mean biomass at anthesis and grain yield ranged from 4200 to 10200 kg ha−1 and 1600 to 3900 kg ha−1, respectively over various sowing times and irrigation regimes. The mean observed response to daytime eCO2 (from 365 to 550 $\mu$mol mol−1 CO2) was relatively consistent for biomass at stem elongation and at anthesis, LAI at anthesis and grain yield with 21{\%}, 23{\%}, 21{\%} and 26{\%}, respectively. Seasonal water use was decreased from 320 to 301 mm (P=0.10) by eCO2, increasing water use efficiency for biomass and yield, 36{\%} and 31{\%}, respectively. The performance of six models (APSIM-WHEAT, APSIM-NWHEAT, CAT, CROPSYST, OLEARY-CONNOR and SALUS) in simulating crop responses to eCO2 were similar and within or close to the experimental error for accumulated biomass, yield and water use response, despite some variations in early growth and LAI. The primary mechanism of biomass accumulation via radiation use efficiency (RUE) or transpiration efficiency (TE) was not critical to define the overall response to eCO2. However, under irrigation the effect of late sowing on response to eCO2 to biomass accumulation at DC65 was substantial in the observed data ({\~{}}40{\%}), but the simulated response was smaller, ranging from 17{\%} to 28{\%}. Simulated response from all six models under no water or nitrogen stress showed similar response to eCO2 under irrigation, but the differences compared to the dryland treatment were small. Further experimental work on the interactive effects of eCO2, water and temperature are required to resolve these model discrepancies. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Boll rots of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) are common in the humid areas of the Southeastern US. One type of boll damage that may be differentiated from others is hardlock, with symptoms that include compression of the fibers within individual locules of mature, open cotton bolls without further obvious disintegration of the lint or damage to the carpel wall. The principal economic effect is that the boll's lint is unharvestable by mechanical cotton pickers. This disease is endemic to the Southeast and can cause severe yield losses up to 70{\%} in some fields. Scanning electron microscopy images of fibers from hardlocked bolls showed flattened and twisted tissue compared to fibers from healthy bolls. Fusarium verticillioides (Saccardo) Nirenberg was the fungus most commonly isolated from seeds of developing cotton bolls. Flowers inoculated with F. verticillioides on the day of bloom by spraying a spore suspension onto the flowers developed significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) more hardlock symptoms compared to untreated controls. The infection process was analyzed using a F. verticillioides isolate tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP). When it was applied to cotton flowers on the day of bloom, the GFP-tagged F. verticillioides strain was detected in the stigma and style by 2 days after bloom (DAB) and in developing seeds at 4, 6, 8, 10, 16, 20, 40, and 60 (open bolls) DAB. By 8 DAB, the GFP F. verticillioides was isolated from over 80{\%} of developing seeds.},

abstract = {Wheat grain weight is a function of rate and duration of grain growth and is affected by photosynthate supply. Drought stress reduces photosynthate production because of stomatal closure. However, this might be partially overcome by an increase in air CO2 concentration. This study was conducted to evaluate elevated CO2 and drought stress effects on grain-filling rate and duration for spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), Spring wheat (cv. Yecora Roja) was grown at two CO2 concentrations, 550 (elevated) or 370 (ambient) pmol mol(-1) and two water treatments in a Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) system at the University of Arizona Maricopa Agricultural Center. Plant samples were collected every 3 to 4 d from 6 d after anthesis until plant maturity. Main stem spikes were separated into upper, middle, and lower sections. Grain weight data for the intact main stem spike, each of its sections, and intact tiller spikes were fitted to a cumulative logistic model. Both elevated CO2 and water treatments significantly influenced the grain-filling processes. Under drought stress conditions, elevated CO2 increased grain weight in the upper and lower sections of the main stem spike by 10 and 24{\%}, respectively. In well-watered plants, final grain weight in the midsection of the main stem spike was 8{\%} higher than that measured under drought stress conditions. Grain weight increase under elevated CO2 was due to a faster rate of grain filling. Effects of elevated CO2 on the statistically derived duration of grain tilling were inconclusive because of the confounding effect of blower-induced temperature changes on the process. An increase in grain weight of well-watered plants was due to a longer grain-tilling period. Later-formed tiller spikes were more responsive to elevated CO2 and drought stress than main stem spikes. Information from this study will help us understand the grain growth of wheat and provide information to establish grain growth mechanism.},

abstract = {Burning of fossil fuel, large scale clearing of forests and other human activities have changed global climate. Atmospheric concentration of radiatively active CO2, methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons has increased to cause global warming. In Australia temperature is projected to rise between 1 and 3 degrees C by 2100. This review is the result of a recent workshop on the potential impact of climate change on plant diseases of economic significance to Australia. It gives an overview of projected changes in Australian climate and the current state of knowledge on the effect of climate change on plant diseases. Based on an assessment of important diseases of wheat and other cereals, sugarcane, deciduous fruits, grapevine, vegetables and forestry species, climate change in Australia may reduce, increase or have no effect on some diseases. Impacts will be felt in altered geographical distribution and crop loss due to changes in the physiology of host-pathogen interaction. Changes will occur in the type, amount and relative importance of pathogens and diseases. Host resistance may be overcome more rapidly due to accelerated pathogen evolution from increased fecundity at high CO2 and/or enhanced UV-B radiation. However, uncertainties about climate change predictions and the paucity of knowledge limit our ability to predict potential impacts on plant diseases. Both experimental and modelling approaches are available for impact assessment research. As the development and implementation of mitigation strategies take a long time, more research is urgently needed and we hope this review will stimulate interest.},

abstract = {Crown rot of wheat in the Pacific Northwest is caused by a complex including Bipolaris sorokiniana, Fusarium avenaceum, E culmorum, E pseudograminearum, and Microdochium nivale. Relative pathogenicity was examined under greenhouse conditions for 178 isolates of the five species, and under field conditions for 24 isolates of B. sorokiniana, F culmorum, and F pseudograminearum. In the greenhouse, all five species reduced (P {\textless} 0.05) plant height relative to noninoculated controls. Disease severity was inversely correlated with plant height for the three Fusarium spp. In one or more of four experiments with spring wheat in the field, all three species reduced stand establishment and density of mature heads and increased the incidence and severity of crown rot. E culmorum and E pseudogramineorum caused the greatest disease severity and plant damage and were the only pathogens that reduced grain yield. Virulence ratings were variable among isolates for each species in all greenhouse and field experiments. Isolate variability was especially high for the location and year variables in field experiments. Mixtures of multiple isolates are required for future research.},

abstract = {The effect of the abiotic stress hormone abscisic acid on plant disease resistance is a neglected field of research. With few exceptions, abscisic acid has been considered a negative regulator of disease resistance. This negative effect appears to be due to the interference of abscisic acid with biotic stress signaling that is regulated by salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene, and to an additional effect of ABA on shared components of stress signaling. However, recent research shows that abscisic acid can also be implicated in increasing the resistance of plants towards pathogens via its positive effect on callose deposition.},

abstract = {Panama wilt disease, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, is a major threat to the cultivation of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.) in tropical and sub-tropical countries. Most varieties of banana, especially those belonging to the Silk group, are highly susceptible to this disease. The fungus can survive and spread through alternate hosts. Ornamental plant species belonging to other families in the order Zingiberales (to which the genus Musa belongs) and the order Alismatales may serve as alternate hosts, and thus transmit the disease to new areas. This study was therefore conducted to screen the infectivity of the pathogen on nine commercially important ornamental plant species using detached leaf tissue-based challenge methodology. Of the ornamental species studied, Dieffenbachia and Strelitzia were found to be completely resistant to the pathogen, as no lesions developed in these species. Alpinia zerumbet, A. purpurea, Heliconia indica, and H. psittacorum showed significant resistance, and lesion areas did not differ significantly from resistant control plants. Among the remaining species, the development of lesion areas in Canna indica, Aglaonema pictum, and Hedychium coronarium was highest, and was significantly higher than in the resistant controls (Ensete superbum). The cultivation, multiplication, and export of ornamental species such as C. indica, A. pictum, and H. coronarium should therefore be avoided in banana-growing hotspots of Panama wilt disease, as these species may serve as alternative hosts for the pathogen.},

abstract = {Phytophthora cinnamomi continues to cause devastating disease in Australian native vegetation and consequently the disease is listed by the Federal Government as a process that is threatening Australia's biodiversity. Although several advances have been made in our understanding of how this soil-borne pathogen interacts with plants and of how we may tackle it in natural systems, our ability to control the disease is limited. The pathogen occurs widely across Australia but the severity of its impact is most evident within ecological communities of the south-west and south-east of the country. A regional impact summary for all states and territories shows the pathogen to be the cause of serious disease in numerous species, a significant number of which are rare and threatened. Manygenera of endemic taxa have a high proportion of susceptible species including the iconic genera Banksia, Epacris and Xanthorrhoea. Long-term studies in Victoria have shown limited but probably unsustainable recovery of susceptible vegetation, given current management practices. Management of the disease in conservation reserves is reliant on hygiene, the use of chemicals and restriction of access, and has had only limited effectiveness and not provided complete control. The deleterious impacts of the disease on faunal habitat are reasonably well documented and demonstrate loss of individual animal species and changes in population structure and species abundance. Few plant species are known to be resistant to P. cinnamomi; however, investigations over several years have discovered the mechanisms by which some plants are able to survive infection, including the activation of defence-related genes and signalling pathways, the reinforcement of cell walls and accumulation of toxic metabolites. Manipulation of resistance and resistance-related mechanisms may provide avenues for protection against disease in otherwise susceptible species. Despite the advances made in Phytophthora research in Australia during the past 40 years, there is still much to be done to give land managers the resources to combat this disease. Recent State and Federal initiatives offer the prospect of a growing and broader awareness of the disease and its associated impacts. However, awareness must be translated into action as time is running out for the large number of susceptible, and potentially susceptible, species within vulnerable Australian ecological communities.},

@article{Bale2010,
abstract = {Insects are highly successful animals inhabiting marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats from the equator to the poles. As a group, insects have limited ability to regulate their body temperature and have thus required a range of strategies to support life in thermally stressful environments, including behavioural avoidance through migration and seasonal changes in cold tolerance. With respect to overwintering strategies, insects have traditionally been divided into two main groups: freeze tolerant and freeze avoiding, although this simple classification is underpinned by a complex of interacting processes, i.e. synthesis of ice nucleating agents, cryoprotectants, antifreeze proteins and changes in membrane lipid composition. Also, in temperate and colder climates, the overwintering ability of many species is closely linked to the diapause state, which often increases cold tolerance ahead of temperature-induced seasonal acclimatisation. Importantly, even though most species can invoke one or both of these responses, the majority of insects die from the effects of cold rather than freezing. Most studies on the effects of a changing climate on insects have focused on processes that occur predominantly in summer (development, reproduction) and on changes in distributions rather than winter survival per se. For species that routinely experience cold stress, a general hypothesis would be that predicted temperature increases of 1 degree C to 5 degrees C over the next 50-100 years would increase winter survival in some climatic zones. However, this is unlikely to be a universal effect. Negative impacts may occur if climate warming leads to a reduction or loss of winter snow cover in polar and sub-polar areas, resulting in exposure to more severe air temperatures, increasing frequency of freeze-thaw cycles and risks of ice encasement. Likewise, whilst the dominant diapause-inducing cue (photoperiod) will be unaffected by global climate change, higher temperatures may modify normal rates of development, leading to a decoupling of synchrony between diapause-sensitive life-cycle stages and critical photoperiods for diapause induction. In terms of climate warming and potential heat stress, the most recent predictions of summer temperatures in Europe of 40 degrees C or higher in 50-75 years, are close to the current upper lethal limit of some insects. Long-term data sets on insect distributions and the timing of annual migrations provide strong evidence for 'positive' responses to higher winter temperatures over timescales of the past 20-50 years in North America, Europe and Asia.},

abstract = {Despite recent reports advancing our understanding of climate change on plant diseases, uncertainty remains concerning how host and pathogen interactions are changed by increases in atmospheric carbon-dioxide (CO2) and temperature. This study has observed crown rot inoculated and non-inoculated plants in three glasshouse environments comprising ambient CO2 with ambient temperature (E1), elevated CO2 with ambient temperature (E2) and elevated CO2 with warm temperatures (E3). The proportion of crown rot infected tillers (incidence), length of stem browning (severity) and biomass of Fusarium pseudograminearum in 16 wheat genotypes was destructively assessed at node development, anthesis, soft dough and crop maturity. Mean incidence, severity and Fusarium biomass was greater in E2, and all three measurements increased at a faster rate across plant development stages; E1 showed the lowest mean incidence and severity. Incidence and severity at each development stage was dependent on the environment each genotype was grown. The influence of genotype on Fusarium biomass at each development stage however was not seen to be dependent on environment. Irrespective of genotype plants with greater severity or relative Fusarium biomass showed lower plant dry weight at crop maturity in all environments with exception to E3, where CR severity did not exert a cost to plant dry weight. These results may allude to plant maturity and temperature-dependent resistance as effective mechanisms in building resistance to crown rot. Regardless of temperature, if crown rot symptoms and Fusarium biomass are to increase at elevated CO2 there is potential for a loss in crop production capability while boosting inoculum in crop stubble.},

abstract = {Drought and heat are the two most important environmental constraints to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production globally and are predicted to become more severe with global climate change. A number of recent studies have reported quantitative trait loci (QTL) for yield and agronomic traits in drought and heat-stressed environments and for physiological traits that contribute to improved performance under stress. The objective of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of reported QTL to identify meta-QTL (MQTL) associated with adaptation to drought and heat stress. In the studies analyzed, QTL were reported for 81 different traits across a range of environments including both field and controlled experiments. A total of 854 individual QTL were reported, with 502 associated with drought stress, 234 with heat stress, and 118 with physiological traits in nonstressed environments. Individual QTL clustered into 66 MQTL regions distributed throughout the genome. There were 43 MQTL that co-localized for both drought and heat stress, 20 specific for drought stress, 2 specific for heat stress, and 1 MQTL specific for physiological traits in nonstressed environments. Quantitative trait loci for plant height, days to maturity, kernel weight, spike density, and canopy temperature were most significantly associated with QTL for yield. Integration of 137 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for heat- and droughtresponsive candidate genes identified 50 SNPs within MQTL confidence intervals, including genes involved in sugar metabolism, scavenging of reactive oxygen species, and abscisic-acidinduced stomatal closure. Identified MQTL and candidate genes can be targeted for future studies and genetic improvement of abiotic stress tolerance in wheat.},

abstract = {The inheritance and fitness of phosphine resistance was investigated in an Australian strain of the rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L.), as well as its prevalence in eastern Australia. This type of knowledge may provide insights in to the development of phosphine resistance in this species with the potential for better management. This strain was 12.2 × resistant at the LC50 level based on results for adults exposed for 20 h. Data from the testing of F1 adults from the reciprocal crosses (R♀ × S♂ and S♀ × R♂) showed that resistance was autosomal and inherited as an incompletely recessive trait with a degree of dominance of −0.88. The dose–response data for the F1 × S and F1 × R test crosses, and the F2 progeny were compared with predicted dose–response assuming monogenic recessive inheritance, and the results were consistent with resistance being conferred by one major gene. There was no evidence of fitness cost based on the frequency of susceptible phenotypes in hybridized populations that were reared for seven generations without exposure to phosphine. Lack of fitness cost suggests that resistant alleles will tend to persist in field populations that have undergone selection even if selection pressure is removed. Discriminating dose tests on 107 population samples collected from farms from 2006 to 2010 show that populations containing insects with the weak resistant phenotype are common in eastern Australia, although the frequency of resistant phenotypes within samples was typically low. The prevalence of resistance is a warning that this species has been subject to considerable selection pressure and that effective resistance management practices are needed to address this problem.},

abstract = {Grain yield of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under Mediterranean conditions is frequently limited by both high temperature and drought during grain growth. In this region, most rain falls during autumn and winter and water deficit emerges in the spring, resulting in a moderate stress for rain fed wheat around anthesis, which increases in severity throughout grain filling. Hence, selection of genotypes with high grain yield is the principal aim of wheat production in this region. In order to evaluate yield and dry matter accumulation in wheat genotypes as affected by terminal drought stress, a factorial experiment based on a randomized complete block design was conducted in the Research Farm Islamic Azad University, Ardabil branch in 2009. Factors were: terminal drought stress by changing in planting date at three levels (12 October, 1 November and 21 November) with wheat (Triticu aestivum L.) genotypes at four levels ('Azar-2', `Sardari', Frankia' and 'Trakia'). The results showed that various levels of terminal drought stress affected yield, dry matter accumulation and leaf area index in wheat genotypes. Mean comparisons showed that maximum grain yield (183.18 gr/m(2)) was obtained for the first planting date or the least duration of confronting with thermal drought stress in 'Azar-2' genotype and the minimum was obtained for the third planting date with 'Trakia' genotype due to the highest duration of confronting with thermal drought stress. Investigation of variance trends of dry matter accumulation indicated that in all of treatment compounds, it increased slowly until 190-200 days after sowing and then increased rapidly until 270-280 days after sowing. From 280 days after sowing to harvest time, it decreased due to increasing aging of leaves and decreasing of leaf area index. On the other hand, wheat genotypes had different responses to dry matter accumulation in confronting with thermal drought stress. Decrease in duration of terminal drought stress also significantly increased leaf area index and its maximum of it was observed by the plots that were applied on the first planting date with 'Azar-2' genotype. In all of the treatment compounds, LAI increased slowly until 190-200 days after sowing and then decreased slowly until 240-250 days after sowing. From 240-250 days after sowing until harvest time, it decreased rapidly due to hastened leaf senescence in confronting with terminal drought stress. Thus, it can be suggested that in order to increase grain yield, dry matter accumulation and leaf area index should be applied 'Azar-2' genotype with the first planting date(12 October) should be applied in the conditions of the Ardabil Plain in Iran.},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) is the most important greenhouse gas, predicted to increase globally from currently 386 to 550 mu mol mol(-1) by 2050 and cause significant stimulation to plant growth. Consequently, in 2007 and 2008, Australian grains free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (AGFACE) facilities were established at Horsham (36 degrees 45'07 '' S lat., 142 degrees 06'52 '' E long., 127 m elevation) and Walpeup (35 degrees 07'20 '' S lat., 142 degrees 00'18 '' E long., 103 m elevation) in Victoria, Australia to investigate the effects of elevated CO(2), water supply and nitrogen fertiliser on crop growth. Understanding the distribution patterns of CO(2) inside AGFACE rings is crucial for the interpretation of the crop growth data. In the AGFACE system, the engineering performance goal was set as having at least 80{\%} of the ring area with a CO(2) concentration [CO(2)] at or above 90{\%} of the target concentration at the ring-centre for 80{\%} of the time. The [CO(2)] was highly variable near the ring-edge where CO(2) is emitted and declined non-linearly with the distance downwind and wind speeds. Larger rings maintained the target [CO(2)] of 550 mu mol mol(-1) at the ring-centres better than the smaller rings. The spatial variation of [CO(2)] depended on ring size and the gap between fumigation and canopy heights but not on wind speeds. The variations in the inner 80{\%} of the rings were found to be higher in smaller rings, implying that the larger rings had more areas of relatively uniform [CO(2)] to conduct experiments.},

abstract = {Rising atmospheric CO(2) greatly enhances plant production, but its effect on biomass allocation, particularly in the presence of environmental stresses, is not well understood. Here, we used meta-analysis combined with pairwise techniques to examine root mass fraction (RMF; i.e., the fraction of root to total biomass) as affected by elevated CO(2) and environmental stresses. Our results showed that lower soil fertility increased RMF and the magnitude was similar for ambient and elevated CO(2)-grown plants. Lower soil water also increased RMF, but to a greater extent at elevated than at ambient CO(2). While CO(2) enrichment had little effect on the magnitude of O(3)-caused reduction in RMF in herbaceous species, it alleviated the adverse effect of higher O(3) on root production in woody species. These results demonstrate that CO(2) has less pronounced effects on RMF than other environmental factors. Under abiotic stresses, e.g., drought and higher O(3), elevated CO(2)-grown plants will likely increase biomass allocation below-ground. Because of the non-uniform changes in drought and O(3) projected for different parts of the world, we conclude that elevated CO(2) will have regional, but not global, effects on biomass allocation under various global change scenarios.},

abstract = {Presymptomatic and accurate diagnosis of Mycosphaerella graminicola leaf blotch is desirable for the disease prediction and the timely application of fungicides. To develop a sensitive PCR assay, four specific primer pairs were designed. They were more specific than three known specific primer pairs. Three of them could detect as little as 0.5 pg M. graminicola DNA in a conventional PCR. A real-time PCR assay was applied for monitoring the disease progression in both inoculated and naturally infected wheat plants using the primer pair ST-rRNA F/R. In inoculated plants, M. graminicola DNA could be detected immediately after inoculation and a steady increase was detected before visible symptoms appeared at 8 days. The rapid growth period took place between 6 and 16 days postinoculation. In the field, the disease progression in the top three leaf layers was followed during the epidemic period. The results were significantly correlated to the disease indices (R=0.8986) and also to the number of pycnidia per leaf (R=0.9227). These suggest that the real-time PCR assay is a reliable approach for the presymptomatic and accurate detection of M. graminicola development in the field.},

abstract = {The response of crop growth and yield to CO2 and ozone is known to depend on climatic conditions and is difficult to quantify due to the complexity of the processes involved. Two modified mechanistic crop simulation models (AFRCWHEAT2-O3 and LINTULCC), which differ in the levels of mechanistic detail, were used to simulate the effects of CO2 (ambient, ambient x2) and ozone (ambient, ambient x1.5) on growth and developmental processes of spring wheat in response to climatic conditions. Simulations were analysed using data from the ESPACE-wheat project in which spring wheat cv. Minaret was grown in open-top chambers at nine sites throughout Europe and for up to 3 years at each site. Both models closely predicted phenological development and the average measured biomass at maturity. However, intermediate growth variables such as biomass and leaf area index (LAI) at anthesis, seasonal accumulated photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the crop (Sigma IPAR), the average seasonal light use efficiency (LUE) and the light saturated rate of flag leaf photosynthesis (A(sat)) were predicted differently and less accurately by the two models. The effect of CO2 on the final biomass was underestimated by AFRCWHEAT2-O3 due to its poor simulation of the effect of CO2 on tillering, and LAI.LINTULCC overestimated the response of biomass production to changes in CO2 level due to an overprediction of the effect of CO2 on LUE. The measured effect of ozone exposure on final biomass was predicted closely by the two models. The models also simulated the observed interactive effect of CO2 and ozone on biomass production. However, the effects of ozone on LAI, Sigma IPAR and A(sat) were simulated differently by the models and less accurately with LINTULCC for the ozone effects on LAI and Sigma IPAR. Predictions of the variation between sites and years of growth and development parameters and of their responses to CO2 and ozone were poor for both AFRCWHEAT2-O3 and LINTULCC. It was concluded that other factors than those considered in the models such as chamber design and soil properties may have affected the growth and development of cv. Minaret. An analysis of the relationships between growth parameters calculated from the simulations supported this conclusion. In order to apply models for global change impact assessment studies, the difficulties in simulating biomass production in response to CO2 need to be considered. We suggest that the simulation of leaf area dynamics deserves particular attention in this regard. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Mycotoxin contamination of wheat kernels and diversity of fungal pathogens were monitored in a survey of 26 fields in Nakuru district, Kenya, in 2006. Sampling was performed twice; at mid-anthesis in July for leaves, stems and spikelets and at harvest in September for spikelets and kernels. Kernels were analysed for the occurrence of 32 mycotoxins using a high performance liquid chromatography 2013 electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) method. Fungi were isolated from surface-sterilized tissues and differentiated morphologically to the genus level. Fusarium isolates were identified based on the sequence of translation elongation factor 1-alpha gene. Eleven Fusarium-related mycotoxins were quantified with deoxynivalenol being detected at highest frequency (69{\%}) and highest concentrations. Occurrence of enniatins in wheat (50{\%}) is reported for the first time in Kenya. Non-Fusarium mycotoxins detected included aflatoxin G2, ochratoxin A, alternariol and alternariol monomethyl ether. Prevalence of Fusarium species on different wheat parts was 100{\%} at both growth stages. Nineteen Fusarium species were identified with seven species 2013Fusarium chlamydosporum, Fusarium boothi, Fusarium poae, Fusarium scirpi, Fusarium arthrosporioides, Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium graminearum2013 accounting for 80{\%} of infections. At anthesis, spikelets and leaves were the most and least susceptible tissue, respectively. At harvest, infection of spikelets was 59{\%} higher than that of kernels.},

abstract = {Ongoing human-induced changes in the composition of the atmosphere continue to stimulate interest in the effects of high CO2 on plants, but its potential impact on inducible plant defense pathways remains poorly defined. Recently, several studies have reported that growth at elevated CO2 is sufficient to induce defenses such as the salicylic acid pathway, thereby increasing plant resistance to pathogens. These reports contrast with evidence that defense pathways can be promoted by photorespiration, which is inhibited at high CO2. Here, we review signaling, metabolic, and redox processes modulated by CO2 levels and discuss issues to be resolved in elucidating the relationships between primary metabolism, inducible defense, and biotic stress resistance. Pathogenesis-related (PR) responses are closely integrated with primary metabolism and influenced by simple compounds involved in plant nutrition, such as sugars, organic acids, and amino acids. Photorespiratory metabolism linked to enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in peroxisomes can induce typical PR responses. Growing plants at increased CO2 levels, which slows photorespiratory rates, can also induce defense metabolism and PR genes, effects that are accompanied by upregulation of ROS signaling. Genes involved in CO2 sensing and signaling in stomatal regulation are beginning to be elucidated but components that link CO2 availability to biotic stress responses remain to be identified. Emerging evidence suggests that metabolite and ROS signaling are likely to be important in linking CO2 availability to the activation of defense metabolism.},

abstract = {Climate warming may raise wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields in cooler climates and lower them in warmer climates. To understand these contrasting effects, infrared heating lamps were used to warm irrigated spring wheat by 1.5 degrees C (day) and 3.0 degrees C (night) above unheated controls during different times of the year at Maricopa, AZ. Changes in wheat growth with warming were used to test hypotheses for temperature effects on crop growth in the process model ecosys. Infrared heating substantially raised phytomass growth and grain yield under lower air temperature (T(a)) following plantings from September through December. The same heating, however, lowered growth and yield under higher T(a) following plantings from January through March. Gains in wheat yield of as much as 200 g C m(-2) with heating under lower T(a) were attributed in the model to more rapid CO(2) fixation and to reduced chilling effects on seed set. These gains were only partially off set by losses from shortened wheat growth periods. Losses in wheat yield of as much as 100 g C m(-2) with heating under higher T(a) were attributed in the model to adverse effects of heating on crop water status and on CO(2) fixation vs. respiration, to greater heat stress effects on seed set, and to shortened crop growth periods. Model hypotheses thus explained contrasting effects of heating on wheat yields under different T(a) found in the field experiment as well as in many earlier studies. Well-constrained tests of these hypotheses are vital for models used to project climate change impacts on agricultural ecosystems.},

This enables us to address questions such as: Following the first report of an invading pathogen, what is the likely incidence of disease? If no cases of disease have been found, how certain can we be that the disease was not simply missed by chance? We il-lustrate the use of spatially explicit stochastic models to optimize targeting of surveillance and control resources. Finally, we discuss how modern detection and diagnostic technologies as well as information from passive surveillance networks (e.g., citizen science) can be integrated into surveillance strategies. 591},

abstract = {Although forecasting Fusarium infections have useful implications, it may be argued that forecasting Fusarium toxins is more useful to help reduce their entry into the food chain. Several disease incidence models have been commercialized for wheat, but only one toxin prediction model from Ontario, Canada, '' DONcast '', has been validated extensively and commercialized to date for wheat, and another has been proposed for maize. In the development of these predictive tools, the variation in toxin levels associated with year and agronomic effects was estimated from simple linear models using wheat and maize samples taken from farm fields. in wheat, environment effects accounted for 48{\%} of the variation in deoxynivalenol (DON) across all fields, followed by variety (27{\%}), and previous crop (14 to 28{\%}). In maize, hybrid accounted for 25{\%} of the variation of either DON or fumonisin, followed by environment (12{\%}), and when combined 42{\%} of the variability was accounted for. The robust site-specific. DON forecast model accounted for up to 80{\%} of the variation in DON, and has been used commercially for 5 years in Canada. Forecasting DON and fumonisins in maize is more difficult, because of its greater exposure to infection, the role of wounding in infection, the more important role of hybrid susceptibility, and the vast array of uncharacterized hybrids available in the marketplace. Nevertheless, using data collected from controlled experiments conducted in Argentina and the Philippines, a model was developed to predict fumonisin concentration using insect damage and weather variables, accounting for 82{\%} of the variability of fumonisins. Using mycotoxins as a measure of disease outcome. as opposed to disease symptoms, offers a more robust prediction of mycotoxin risk, and it accounts for mycotoxin accumulation that occurs frequently in the absence of any change in Fusarium symptoms.

Plants were grown at the two CO2 concentrations in a repeated experiment in the CEF and inoculated at 6, 9, or 12 weeks of age. Although the physiological maturity of plants was at a similar stage for all three ages, the number of lesions per plant increased with increasing plant age at both CO2 concentrations. At 350 ppm, the increase was associated with canopy size and increasing infection efficiency of the pathogen, but at 700 ppm. it was associated only with canopy size, because infection efficiency did not change with increasing age. A level of resistance was induced in plants at 700 ppm M. In a second study, plants were raised for 12 to 14 weeks at the two CO2 concentrations in the CEF and exposed to C. gloeosporioides inoculum in replicated field plots under ambient CO2. Over three Successive years. Fitzroy developed a dense and enlarged canopy. with 28 to 46{\%} more nodes, leaf area, and above-ground biomass at high CO2 than at low M. Up to twice as many lesions per plant were produced in the high CO2 plants, because the enlarged canopy trapped many more pathogen spores. The transient induced resistance in high CO2 plants failed to operate when exposed to pathogen inoculum under ambient CO2 in the field. These results highlight the need to consider both canopy size and host resistance in assessing the influence of elevated CO2 on plant disease.},

abstract = {Thirty-eight strains of the entomopathogenic Beauveria bassiana, isolated from diverse species of Lepidoptera (Pyralidae) or Coleoptera (Curculionidae, Chrysomelidae, and Scolytidae) from various geographical sites, were examined by RFLP and RAPD analyses. Similar groupings were recovered from both approaches and these showed clear relationships between the population structure of B. bassiana and some defined host species. Strains isolated from members of the Pyralidae were recovered as two main groups, one group consisted of all strains isolated from Ostrinia irrespective of their origin. The second group consisted primarily of strains isolated from Diatraea in Cuba. All strains isolated from the curculionid genus Sitona clustered as a single distinct group, separated from strains from other curculionids. In contrast, strains isolated from the pyralid genus Maliarpha, and the coleopteran Chrysomelidae, gave heterogenous patterns and were not recovered as distinct groups. Groups from cluster analysis and non- hierarchic ordination methods were compared and the relative merits of the different grouping strategies are discussed.},

abstract = {The possibility that future climate change may affect agriculture has attracted considerable attention(1,2). As a step towards evaluating such influences, the effect of climate trends over the past few decades(3) needs to be assessed. Here I estimate the contribution of climate trends in Australia(4,5) to the substantial increase in Australian wheat yields since 1952. Non-climatic influences-such as new cultivars and changes in crop management practices-are removed by detrending the wheat yield and climate variables and using the residuals to calculate quantitative relationships between variations in climate and yield. Climate trends appear to be responsible for 30-50{\%} of the observed increase in wheat yields, with increases in minimum temperatures being the dominant influence. This approach should be applicable in other regions for which sufficient data exist.},

abstract = {This review focuses on recent advances in some key areas of wheat physiology, namely phasic development, determination of potential yield and water-limited potential yield, tolerance to some other abiotic stresses ( aluminium, salt, heat shock), and simulation modelling. Applications of the new knowledge to breeding and crop agronomy are emphasized. The linking of relatively simple traits like time to flowering, and aluminium and salt tolerance, in each case to a small number of genes, is being greatly facilitated by the development of molecular gene markers, and there is some progress on the functional basis of these links, and likely application in breeding. However with more complex crop features like potential yield, progress at the gene level is negligible, and even that at the level of the physiology of seemingly important component traits (e.g., grain number, grain weight, soil water extraction, sensitivity to water shortage at meiosis) is patchy and generally slow although a few more heritable traits (e.g. carbon isotope discrimination, coleoptile length) are seeing application. This is despite the advent of smart tools for molecular analysis and for phenotyping, and the move to study genetic variation in soundly-constituted populations. Exploring the functional genomics of traits has a poor record of application; while trait validation in breeding appears underinvested. Simulation modeling is helping to unravel G x E interaction for yield, and is beginning to explore genetic variation in traits in this context, but adequate validation is often lacking. Simulation modelling to project agronomic options over time is, however, more successful, and has become an essential tool, probably because less uncertainty surrounds the influence of variable water and climate on the performance of a given cultivar. It is the ever-increasing complexity we are seeing with genetic variation which remains the greatest challenge for modelling, molecular biology, and indeed physiology, as they all seek to progress yield at a rate greater than empirical breeding is achieving.},

abstract = {Mapping disease transmission risk is crucial in public and animal health for evidence based decision-making. Ecology and epidemiology are highly related disciplines that may contribute to improvements in mapping disease, which can be used to answer health related questions. Ecological niche modeling is increasingly used for understanding the biogeography of diseases in plants, animals, and humans. However, epidemiological applications of niche modeling approaches can fail to generate robust study designs, generating incomplete or incorrect inferences. This manuscript is an overview of the history and conceptual bases behind ecological niche modeling, specifically as applied to epidemiology and public health; it does not pretend to be an exhaustive and detailed description of ecological niche modeling literature and methods. Instead, this review includes selected state-of-the-science approaches and tools, providing a short guide to designing studies incorporating information on the type and quality of the input data (i.e., occurrences and environmental variables), identification and justification of the extent of the study area, and encourages users to explore and test diverse algorithms for more informed conclusions. We provide a friendly introduction to the field of disease biogeography presenting an updated guide for researchers looking to use ecological niche modeling for disease mapping. We anticipate that ecological niche modeling will soon be a critical tool for epidemiologists aiming to map disease transmission risk, forecast disease distribution under climate change scenarios, and identify landscape factors triggering outbreaks.},

abstract = {This paper summarises the key findings from recent research on the population genetics and epidemiology of Fusarium pathogens causing head blight and crown rot of wheat in Australia and how this information has enabled the screening and selection of wheat germplasm with improved resistance to Fusarium. By relating new findings to the current state of knowledge, the paper serves as a timely and critical review of the international literature. In Australia, both Fusarium pseudograminearum and F. graminearum can cause both crown rot and Fusarium head blight under artificial inoculation. However, the former species is more widespread and is predominantly associated with crown rot whereas F. graminearum is mainly associated with Fusarium head blight, with limited geographical distribution in and around the Liverpool Plains in northern New South Wales. Studies of population structure and genetics have revealed that both species are genotypically diverse with similar levels of genetic recombination despite Gibberella zeae, the teleomorph of F. graminearum, being homothallic and G. coronicola, the teleomorph of F. pseudograminearum, being heterothallic. A high-throughput and reliable crown rot bioassay has been developed and used to screen over 1500 wheat germplasms to select 17 lines with putative crown rot resistance. Key differences in pathogen biology and epidemiology between Australia and the USA have emerged from other recent collaborative studies, which show that macroconidia constitute the bulk of aerial Fusarium head blight inoculum in Australia, whereas ascospores are the dominant primary inoculum for Fusarium head blight worldwide. The limited spread of splash-dispersed macroconidia of F. graminearum probably explains the restricted geographical distribution of this species in Australia. Other research collaboration has compared the aggressiveness, mycotoxin production and genotypic polymorphisms of the pathogen population from Australia and the USA. These and other differences in pathogen adaptation emphasise that research outcomes from elsewhere must be tested for relevance before applying them to Australian farming systems.},

There was no clear association between DON production in grain culture and the overall aggressiveness on the three varieties for isolates from Australia (Fig. 3). The story was somewhat similar for F. graminearum from the USA with little evidence of a relationship between the DON production

Nitrogen stimulates root and shoot growth, which can accelerate soil moisture depletion leading to moisture stress at crop maturity if nitrogen inputs are not balanced with stored soil water at sowing. Low soil water after tillering appears to increase CR severity, and nitrogen can increase severity in both low and high soil water conditions (Verrell et al. 2003).},

abstract = {Over time, the relative effect of elevated [CO2] on the photosynthesis and dry matter (DM) production of rice crops is likely to be changed with increasing duration of Co-2 exposure. However, there is no systemic information on interactive effects of elevated [CO2] and nitrogen (N) supply on seasonal changes in phosphorus (P) nutrient of rice crops. In order to investigate the interactive effects of these two factors on seasonal changes in plant P concentration, uptake, efficiency and allocation, a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment was conducted at Wuxi, Jiangsu, China, in 2001-2003. A japonica cultivar with large panicle was grown at ambient or elevated (ca. 200 mu mol mol(-1) above ambient) [CO2] and supplied with three levels of N: low (LN, 15 g N m(2)), medium (MN, 25 g N m(2)) and high N (HN, 35 g N m(2) (2002, 2003)). The MN level was similar to that recommended to local farmers. FACE significantly increased shoot P concentration (dry base) over the season, the average responses varied between 7.3{\%} and 16.2{\%}. Shoot P uptake responses to FACE declined gradually with crop development, with average responses of 57{\%}, 51 {\%}, 37{\%}, 26{\%} and 11{\%} on average during the growth periods from transplanting to early-tillering (Period I), early-tillering to mid-fillering (Period II), mid-tillering to panicle initiation (Period III), panicle initiation to heading (Period IV) and heading to grain maturity (Period V), respectively. Seasonal changes in shoot P uptake ratio (i.e., the ratio of shoot P uptake during a given growth period to final shoot P acquisition at grain maturity) responses to FACE followed a similar pattern to that of shoot P uptake, with average responses of 19{\%}, 14{\%}, 3{\%}, -5{\%} and - 16{\%} in Periods I, II, III, IV and V of the growth period, respectively. As a result, FACE enhanced shoot P uptake by 33{\%} at grain maturity. P allocation patterns among above-ground organs were not altered by FACE before heading, but it was modified after heading, with a shift in P allocation patterns towards vegetative organ. FACE resulted in the significant decrease in P-use efficiency for biomass across the season and P-use efficiency for grain yield and P harvest index at grain maturity. Generally, there were no interactions between [CO2] and N supply on above P nutrient variables measured. Data from this study has important implications for P management in rice production systems under future elevated [CO2] conditions. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Global food production must increase by 50{\%} to meet the projected demand of the world's population by 2050. Meeting this difficult challenge will be made even harder if climate change melts portions of the Himalayan glaciers to affect 25{\%} of world cereal production in Asia by influencing water availability. Pest and disease management has played its role in doubling food production in the last 40 years, but pathogens still claim 10–16{\%} of the global harvest. We consider the effect of climate change on the many complex biological interactions affecting pests and pathogen impacts and how they might be manipulated to mitigate these effects. Integrated solutions and international co-ordination in their implementation are considered essential. Providing a background on key constraints to food security, this overview uses fusarium head blight as a case study to illustrate key influences of climate change on production and quality of wheat, outlines key links between plant diseases, climate change and food security, and highlights key disease management issues to be addressed in improving food security in a changing climate.},
annote = {Food security can be defined as ‘‘when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life'' (FAO, 2003) or ‘‘fair prices, choice, access through open and competitive markets, continuous improvements in food safety, transition to healthier diets, and a more environmentally sustainable food chain'' (Anonymous, 2008a), although a simpler definition could be ‘the risk of adequate food not being available'. It is a combination of multiple food availability, food access and food utilization issues

The ‘fertilization effect' of increasing CO2 increases crop biomass and grain yield (Ainsworth{\&}Long, 2005), raising the possibility of increased food production.However, emerging evidence of reduced grain yield from high temperature and water limitations (Anwar et al., 2007; Torriani et al., 2007) make a wholesale increase in crop productivity unlikely. Also, the impacts of plant diseases, mostly ignored in assessments of global food security
under climate change, minimize or reverse any beneﬁt from the CO2 fertilization effect (Fernandes et al., 2004; Butterworth et al., 2010)

The FAO estimated that 1{\AE}02 billion people went hungry in 2009, the highest ever level of world hunger,mainly as a result of declining investment in agriculture (Anonymous, 2010)

Conditions will be evenmore difﬁcult if climate change results in melting of portions of the Himalayan glaciers, disturbs the monsoon pattern and increases ﬂooding ⁄ drought in Asia, as this will affect 25{\%} of the world's cereal production through increased uncertainty over the availability of water for irrigation and more frequent ﬂoods affecting lives and livelihoods.

will the yield loss be the same for a necrotroph and a biotroph under two different available nitrogen levels, and will this relationship remain the same with increased CO2 and temperature? Will a drought or heat stress affect both in the same way? Furthermore, any such relationships may be speciﬁc to particular crops, environments or agronomic regimes.

However, whilst in natural ecological communities we might expect these to be acquired by normal natural selection processes, in agricultural systems different traits may be prioritized as crops are grown in intra- rather than inter-genotypic competition and thus have lost functional diversity (Newton et al., 2009). In such monocultures, the use of major genes for resistance to pathogens is likely to lead to strong selection on pathogen populations to overcome them (Pangga et al., 2011) whereas in heterogeneous communities it may lead to stability (e.g. Huang et al., 1994)

Compared with wild plants, crops have had their developmental cycle changed to enhance yield, for example by producing larger fruiting bodies or larger grain sizes, making the assimilate-remobilization phase more vulnerable to pest and pathogen attack (Newton et al., 2010a)

However, we should ideally be breeding for and managing ‘ecological tolerance', since managing levels of pathogens that cause little yield loss is likely to be a far more robust control strategy than trying to eliminate all pathogens (Newton et al., 2010b).

Given the likelihood of a more variable climate with more frequent extreme weather events (Pachauri {\&} Reisinger, 2007), there is likely to be a trend towards limiting crop geoclimatic distributions to the low-risk areas away from the high-risk areas

Wheat is the most important source of carbohydrate (Curtis et al., 2002) providing, on average, one-fifth of the total calorific input of the world's population and half the total dietary calories in regions such as North Africa, Turkey and Central Asia (Reynolds et al., 2008). Wheat is processed into many end products to provide for sophisticated consumers and grain quality increasingly influences international grain trading (Blakeney et al., 2009).

About half the global wheat area of {\textgreater}200 million hectares is in less developed countries where there have been steady increases in productivity from genetic improvements in yield potential, resistance to diseases, adaptation to abiotic stresses and better agronomic practices.

The quantitative relationships between weather, cropping practices and mycotoxin concentrations (Champeil et al., 2004) form the basis of mycotoxin forecasts such as DONCAST (Schaafsma {\&} Hooker, 2007). In general, the potential for high concentrations of mycotoxin in grains generally increases with the number of rainy days and days with relative humidity {\textgreater}75{\%}, but decreases with temperature 32 C (Schaafsma {\&} Hooker,
2007).

Fusarium culmorum and Microdochium nivale have been the prevalent species in cooler temperate climates of Europe, but in the last decade F. graminearum has become the dominant species causing FHB in the Netherlands (Waalwijk et al., 2003), England and Wales (Jennings et al., 2004) and northern Germany (Miedaner et al., 2008), because its higher temperature optimum favours its dominance in the disease complex. Since M. nivale is non-toxigenic and F. culmorum generally produces less mycotoxin than F. graminearum, mycotoxin concentrations may consequently increase.In Canada, a 3ADON chemotype of F. graminearum with increased toxigenic and ecological fitness had replaced the 15ADON chemotype indicating genetic differentiation along environmental gradients (Ward et al., 2008). Two recent reviews have considered these and other changes in FHB pathogen populations with potential concomitant changes in mycotoxin contamination (Xu {\&} Nicholson, 2009; Paterson {\&} Lima, 2010) and discussion about climate change and mycotoxins appears in Paterson {\&} Lima (2010) and Magan et al. (2011). changes in the appearance of mycotoxins because of climate change.

Using linked models for FHB, wheat and climate change, Fernandes et al. (2004) projected the risk of FHB in selected areas of Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina to show that the risk index was greater under climate change scenarios than at any time during the last 30 years

Under climate change grain quality may deteriorate as a direct effect of increasing temperature and CO2 that reduces protein and micronutrient content in grain,

Conditions during storage can increase DON concentration several fold within a few weeks if contaminated grains are stored with high moisture levels (Birzele et al., 2000), but grains stored at a moisture activity of {\pounds}0{\AE}70 aw (approximately 10–11{\%} moisture content) will not generally spoil or produce mycotoxins.

Although the severity and toxigenicity is projected to increase under climate change (combination of rainfall and temperature at anthesis) with an altered distribution of FHB (Madgwick et al., 2010), the information is not enough to make generalization such as ‘‘increasing climate variability will produce more frequent epidemics of FHB'' (Miller, 2008).

To be effective, partial resistance has to be combined with agronomic and other practices to develop robust integrated crop protection strategies, which will not suffer such boom–bust cycles. Knowledge of pathogen biology and epidemiology in farming systems must improve significantly to account for changes in geographical distribution of crops to better manage necrotrophs under climate change

Worldwide, for every 100 agricultural workers, between one and three suffer acute pesticide poisoning, leading to many thousands of fatalities; developing countries experience 99{\%} of the deaths while using 25{\%} of the world's production of pesticides (UNEP, 2004).

Between 1991 and 2000, total agricultural research and development spending declined by 0{\AE}4{\%} annually in Africa, but increased by 3{\AE}3{\%} in Asia. As a result, land productivity in East Asia increased from US{\$}1485 ha)1 in 1992 to US{\$}2129 ha)1 in 2006, but declined in sub-Saharan Africa from 79{\%} of that in East Asia in 1992 to59{\%}in 2006 (IFPRI, 2008).

From a food-security perspective, emphasis must now shift from impact assessment to developing adaptation and mitigation strategies and options.

firstly, to evaluate under climate change the efficacy of current physical, chemical and biological control tactics including disease-resistant cultivars, and secondly, to include future climate scenarios in all research aimed at developing new tools and tactics. Transgenic solutions (Huang et al., 2002) must receive serious consideration in integrated disease management strategies to improve food security.},

abstract = {Winter wheat and rice straw produced under ambient and elevated CO(2) in a China rice-wheat rotation free-air CO(2) enrichment (FACE) experiment was mixed with a paddy soil at a rate of 10 g kg(-1) (air-dried), and the mixture was incubated under flooded conditions at 25 degrees C to examine the differences in decomposition as well as the products of crop residues produced under elevated CO(2). Results showed that the C/N ratio and the amount of soluble fraction in the amended rice straw grown under elevated CO(2) (FR) were 9.8{\%} and 73.1{\%} greater, and the cellulose and lignin were 16.0{\%} and 9.9{\%} lesser than those of the amended rice straw grown under ambient CO(2) (AR), respectively. Compared with those of the AR treatment, the CO(2)-C and CH(4)-C emissions in the FR treatment for 25 d were increased by 7.9{\%} and 25.0{\%}, respectively; a higher ratio of CH(4) to CO(2) emissions induced by straw in the FR treatment was also observed. In contrast, in the treatments with winter wheat straw, the CO(2)-C and CH(4)-C emissions, the ratio of straw-induced CH(4) to CO(2) emissions, and the straw composition were not significantly affected by elevated CO(2), except for an 8.0{\%} decrease in total N and a 9.7{\%} increase in C/N ratio in the wheat straw grown under elevated CO(2). Correlation analysis showed that the net CO(2)-C and CH(4)-C emission from straw and the ratio of straw-induced CH(4) to CO(2) emissions were all exponentially related to the amount of soluble fraction in the amended straw (P {\textless} 0.05). These indicated that under flooded conditions, the turnover and CH(4) emission from crop straw incorporated into soil were dependent on the effect of elevated CO(2) on straw composition, and varied with crop species. Incorporation of rice straw grown under elevated CO(2) would stimulate CH(4) emission from flooded rice fields, whereas winter wheat straw grown under elevated CO(2) had no effect on CH(4) emission.},

abstract = {Fusarium oxysporum is an economically important pathogen causing wilting or rotting disease symptoms in a large number of crops. It is proposed to have a structured, “two-speed” genome: i.e. regions containing genes involved in pathogenicity cluster with transposons on separate accessory chromosomes. This is hypothesized to enhance evolvability. Given the continuum of adaptation of all the genes encoded in a genome, however, one would expect a more complex genome structure. By comparing the genome of reference strain Fol4287 to those of 58 other Fusarium oxysporum strains, we found that some Fol4287 accessory chromosomes are lineage-specific, while others occur in multiple lineages with very high sequence similarity - but only in strains that infect the same host as Fol4287. This indicates that horizontal chromosome transfer has been instrumental in past host-switches. Unexpectedly, we found that the sequence of the three smallest core chromosomes (Chr. 11, 12 and 13) is more divergent than that of the other core chromosomes. Moreover, these chromosomes are enriched in genes involved in metabolism and transport and genes that are differentially regulated during infection. Interestingly, these chromosomes are –like the accessory chromosomes– marked by histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and depleted in histone H3 lysine 4 dimethylation (H3K4me2). Detailed genomic analyses revealed a complex, “multi-speed genome” structure in Fusarium oxysporum. We found a strong association of H3K27me3 with elevated levels of sequence divergence that is independent of the presence of repetitive elements. This provides new leads into how clustering of genes evolving at similar rates could increase evolvability.},

A 24 h interval from heat shock to inoculation allowed the development of maximum resistance. The different cucumber cultivars exhibited distinct induced resistance to C. cucumerinum.

abstract = {Although central to much biological research, the identification of species is often difficult. The use of DNA barcodes, short DNA sequences from a standardized region of the genome, has recently been proposed as a tool to facilitate species identification and discovery. However, the effectiveness of DNA barcoding for identifying specimens in species-rich tropical biotas is unknown. Here we show that cytochrome c oxidase I DNA barcodes effectively discriminate among species in three Lepidoptera families from Area de Conservaci{\'{o}}n Guanacaste in northwestern Costa Rica. We found that 97.9{\%} of the 521 species recognized by prior taxonomic work possess distinctive cytochrome c oxidase I barcodes and that the few instances of interspecific sequence overlap involve very similar species. We also found two or more barcode clusters within each of 13 supposedly single species. Covariation between these clusters and morphological and/or ecological traits indicates overlooked species complexes. If these results are general, DNA barcoding will significantly aid species identification and discovery in tropical settings.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Levels of organic carbon within agricultural soils in Australia continue to decline predominantly due to intensive cultivation. Such practices place sustainable use of agricultural soils at risk. The aim of the present study was to test whether selected melanised endophytic fungi could enhance organic carbon in an experimental soil. In a compartmental pot study, 20 melanised endophytic fungi significantly increased carbon in an aggregated carbon-rich Alfisol over 14 weeks, with increases of up to 17{\%} measured. Two of these fungi increased organic carbon within microaggregates. This study demonstrates that some melanised endophytic fungi have the potential to increase levels of organic carbon within an experimental soil. Melanin, a polyaromatic compound present within the cell walls of melanised endophytic fungi, may have contributed towards increases in organic carbon, particularly if protected within soil aggregates. Deposition of aromatic carbon within aggregates would leave this carbon less susceptible to oxidation and contribute towards long-term carbon storage in soils.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The cereal pathogen Fusarium graminearum is the primary cause of Fusarium head blight (FHB) and a significant threat to food safety and crop production. To elucidate population structure and identify genomic targets of selection within major FHB pathogen populations in North America we sequenced the genomes of 60 diverse F. graminearum isolates. We also assembled the first pan-genome for F. graminearum to clarify population-level differences in gene content potentially contributing to pathogen diversity. Bayesian and phylogenomic analyses revealed genetic structure associated with isolates that produce the novel NX-2 mycotoxin, suggesting a North American population that has remained genetically distinct from other endemic and introduced cereal-infecting populations. Genome scans uncovered distinct signatures of selection within populations, focused in high diversity, frequently recombining regions. These patterns suggested selection for genomic divergence at the trichothecene toxin gene cluster and thirteen additional regions containing genes potentially involved in pathogen specialization. Gene content differences further distinguished populations, in that 121 genes showed population-specific patterns of conservation. Genes that differentiated populations had predicted functions related to pathogenesis, secondary metabolism and antagonistic interactions, though a subset had unique roles in temperature and light sensitivity. Our results indicated that F. graminearum populations are distinguished by dozens of genes with signatures of selection and an array of dispensable accessory genes, suggesting that FHB pathogen populations may be equipped with different traits to exploit the agroecosystem. These findings provide insights into the evolutionary processes and genomic features contributing to population divergence in plant pathogens, and highlight candidate genes for future functional studies of pathogen specialization across evolutionarily and ecologically diverse fungi.},

abstract = {The production situation-injury profile paradigm can be used as a framework to assess the harmfulness of multiple-pest complexes in a changing agriculture. A mechanistic simulation model for wheat, WHEATPEST, was developed to incorporate drivers of (i) variable production situations and (ii) their related injury profiles. The model simulates the harmful effects of pathogens, pests, and weeds in a simple, open, generic manner. Simulation drivers were derived from published reports, in particular through a meta-analysis of highly detailed farmers' field surveys in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Preliminary analysis of the model's performances indicates that WHEATPEST conforms with available published reports in a range of production situations and injury profiles. While improvement on some components of the model are discussed, this work points at the need for the collection of cross-disciplinary, reasonably accurate, and standardised data at a system's level, and at the usefulness of modelling tools for basic research and policy.

abstract = {Members of the Fusarium genus are important components of many plant2013soil systems worldwide and are responsible for many crop diseases. Knowledge of the relative influence of biotic and abiotic factors on this genus is therefore of broad economic and ecological importance. In order to address this issue, we examined Fusarium communities in soils nearby apparently healthy and symptomatic asparagus plants in 50 fields scattered in four agricultural regions of Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada. Fusarium community structure and abundance were assessed using genus-specific PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and CFU counts, respectively. Multivariate statistical analyses were used to detect community patterns related to spatial, abiotic and biotic factors. Results suggested that Fusarium community structure (i.e. the presence and absence of the different Fusarium sequence variants in the samples) in soil is mainly related to biotic factors (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and bacterial community structure), whereas Fusarium abundance is more closely related to abiotic factors (mainly clay, organic matter, NH4, Na and Cu). Some degree of influence of spatial patterns was also observed on both Fusarium community structure and abundance with, for instance, a large regional variation in Fusarium community structure. However, Fusarium community structure was not directly related to the disease status of nearby asparagus plants.},

abstract = {We investigated the hypothesis that resistance to deoxynivalenol (DON) is a major resistance factor in the Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance complex of wheat. Ninety-six double haploid lines from a cross between 'CM-82036'and 'Remus' were examined. The lines were tested for DON resistance after application of the toxin in the ear, and for resistances to initial infection and spread of FHB after artificial inoculation with Fusarium spp. Toxin application to flowering ears induced typical FHB symptoms. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses detected one locus with a major effect on DON resistance (logarithm of odds = 53.1, R-2 = 92.6). The DON resistance phenotype was closely associated with an important FHB resistance QTL, Qjhs.ndsu-3BS, which previously was identified as governing resistance to spread of symptoms in the ear. Resistance to the toxin was correlated with resistance to spread of FHB (r = 0.74, P {\textless} 0.001). In resistant wheat lines, the applied toxin was converted to DON-3-O-glucoside as the detoxification product. There was a close relation between the DON-3-glucoside/DON ratio and DON resistance in the toxintreated ears (R-2 = 0.84). We conclude that resistance to DON is important in the FHB resistance complex and hypothesize that Qfhs.ndsu-3BS either encodes a DON-glucosyltransferase or regulates the expression of such an enzyme.},

abstract = {The effects of barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) infection on oat plants growing in pots in a greenhouse were incorporated into a plant growth model driven by incident solar radiation and air temperature. Changes in radiation use efficiency (RUE) and leaf area determining parameters were calibrated against observed reductions in leaf area, shoot biomass and grain yield. Plants were infected with BYDV-PAV at the two-leaf stage or left uninfected. Two nitrogen fertilization levels were used. BYDV-infected plants had smaller above-ground biomass and a smaller green plant area than uninfected plants. The decreased biomass could be explained by a decrease in leaf area, causing a decreased radiation interception and growth. Relatively higher RUE in the infected plants during a period of the growing season partially compensated for growth reductions due to the smaller leaf area. Increased RUE of the infected plants was related to higher nitrogen concentration per leaf area. The effects of an infection were similar for the two nitrogen fertilization treatments.},

Incubation period to the onset of lesion development, number of lesions and lesion diameter were assessed. Symptomless growth of L. maculans from leaf lesions to stems was investigated using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing isolate carrying AvrLm6.

With increasing temperature/wetness duration, numbers of lesions/spots generally increased. GFP-expressing L. maculans grew from leaf lesions down leaf petioles to stems on DarmorMX at 25 degrees C but not at 15 degrees C.

abstract = {Shah, D. A., De Wolf, E. D., Paul, P. A., and Madden, L. V. 2014. Predicting Fusarium head blight epidemics with boosted regression trees. Phytopathology 104:702-714. Predicting major Fusarium head blight (FHB) epidemics allows for the judicious use of fungicides in suppressing disease development. Our objectives were to investigate the utility of boosted regression trees (BRTs) for predictive modeling of FHB epidemics in the United States, and to compare the predictive performances of the BRT models with those of logistic regression models we had developed previously. The data included 527 FHB observations from 15 states over 26 years. BRTs were fit to a training data set of 369 FHB observations, in which FHB epidemics were classified as either major (severity ≥ 10{\%}) or non-major (severity {\textless} 10{\%}), linked to a predictor matrix consisting of 350 weather-based variables and categorical variables for wheat type (spring or winter), presence or absence of corn residue, and cultivar resistance. Predictive performance was estimated on a test (holdout) data set con-sisting of the remaining 158 observations. BRTs had a misclassification rate of 0.23 on the test data, which was 31{\%} lower than the average misclassification rate over 15 logistic regression models we had presented earlier. The strongest predictors were generally one of mean daily relative humidity, mean daily temperature, and the number of hours in which the temperature was between 9 and 30°C and relative humidity ≥ 90{\%} simul-taneously. Moreover, the predicted risk of major epidemics increased substantially when mean daily relative humidity rose above 70{\%}, which is a lower threshold than previously modeled for most plant pathosys-tems. BRTs led to novel insights into the weather–epidemic relationship.},

abstract = {A weather-based simulation model, called Powdery Mildew of Cucurbits Simulation (POMICS), was constructed to predict fungicide application scheduling to manage powdery mildew of cucurbits. The model was developed on the principle that conditions favorable for Podosphaera xanthii, a causal pathogen of this crop disease, generate a number of infection cycles in a single growing season. The model consists of two components that (i) simulate the disease progression of P. xanthii in secondary infection cycles under natural conditions and (ii) predict the disease severity with application of fungicides at any recurrent disease cycles. The underlying environmental factors associated with P. xanthii infection were quantified from laboratory and field studies, and also gathered from literature. The performance of the POMICS model when validated with two datasets of uncontrolled natural infection was good (the mean difference between simulated and observed disease severity on a scale of 0 to 5 was 0.02 and 0.05). In simulations, POMICS was able to predict high- and low-risk disease alerts. Furthermore, the predicted disease severity was responsive to the number of fungicide applications. Such responsiveness indicates that the model has the potential to be used as a tool to guide the scheduling of judicious fungicide applications.},

abstract = {Massive population displacements are now regularly presented as one of the most dramatic possible consequences of climate change. Current forecasts and projections show that regions that would be affected by such population movements are low-lying islands, coastal and deltaic regions, as well as sub-Saharan Africa. Such estimates, however, are usually based on a 2°C temperature rise. In the event of a 4°C+ warming, not only is it likely that climate-induced population movements will be more considerable, but also their patterns could be significantly different, as people might react differently to temperature changes that would represent a threat to their very survival. This paper puts forward the hypothesis that a greater temperature change would affect not only the magnitude of the associated population movements, but also—and above all—the characteristics of these movements, and therefore the policy responses that can address them. The paper outlines the policy evolutions that climate-induced displacements in a 4°C+ world would require.},

F. oxy race 1 produced severe symptoms on most Heliconia spp. while race 2 rarely produced symptoms on heliconia spp.

Fusarium isolated from heliconia produced no symptoms in Musa plantain 'Chato/Bluggoe'

Infected Heliconia plants growing adjacent to 'Gros Michelle' banana plants did not infect the banana plants after one year growing in the same concrete tanks

Some Fusarium isolates from heliconia were reported to produce "moderate to severe discoloration in the seedling rhizomes" of M. balbisiana "and produced yellow wilting leaves."

Heliconia species obtained from a banana planation showing symptoms of wilt produced Fusarium isolates which could infect M.balbisiana with "severe wilt symptoms"


MY interpretation of this paper
The author does a good job at showing pathogenicity of isolates obtained from various sources on heliconia and banana. there was no effort to show the pathogen from heliconia was distinct to the two banana race pathogens. Both race 1 and 2 are capable of infecting some Heliconia spp. with severe infections, Fusarium isolated from Heliconia were unlikely to cause symptoms and when they did they were very little or "indistinguishable to F.oxy race 2". It likely that the isolates found on heliconia were primarily banana pathogens and had infected heliconia plants. The statement "Fusarium isolated from Heliconia plants collected within a 'Gros Michelle' showing severe disease were pathogenic of Gros banana" reinforces this conclusion.
My deduction is that Race 3 was actually either race 1 or 2 isolated from .

abstract = {Knowing pests and diseases that may cause injuries and are likely to affect plant health and quality is critical to minimizing the gap between attainable yield and actual yield. In this paper, we highlight concepts and strategies aimed at controlling major biotic constraints affecting wheat in intensive production systems and present emerging challenges, with a special attention to the developing world. Disease epidemics result from the combination of inoculum, favorable environment, and host susceptibility. Changes in cropping systems as a result of adoption of conservation agriculture may have serious implications. Necrotrophic pathogens such as those responsible for tan spot or septorias are likely to emerge, and Fusarium head blight may increase. However, resistance breeding combined with rotations, timely sowing, and irrigation or even fungicide utilization, if affordable, are part of integrated crop management practices that can minimize losses. In South Asia, the effect of spot blotch, a devastating foliar disease caused by Cochliobolus sativus, can be minimized by reducing physiological stress through timely sowing and adequate use of fertilizers, which demonstrates the complex relationships among crop physiology, disease resistance, and yield. Although some root rots that induce premature death of tillers in cooler high-yielding humid environments can be important, the dryland crown rot (Fusarium spp.), common root rot (C. sativus), and the cereal nematode (Heterodera spp. and Pratylenchus spp.) should not be ignored. These are all known to be much more damaging under suboptimal moisture (rainfed or supplementary irrigation), particularly where plant growth is stressed. Climate change is likely to modify the wheat disease spectrum in some regions, and pathogens or pests considered unimportant today may turn out to be potential new threats in future.},

abstract = {Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis (DC.) E.O. Speer f. sp. tritici Em. Marchal (syn. Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici), is one of the major diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. Race-specific resistance has been extensively used in wheat breeding programs, even though it is ephemeral. Adult plant resistance (APR) to powdery mildew is more durable than race-specific resistance. The APR to powdery mildew in winter wheat cultivar Massey has remained effective since its release in 1981. A cross was made between Massey and a powdery mildew susceptible cultivar Becker. Powdery mildew severity on F-2 leaves (the second leaf below the flag leaf) of 180 F2:3 lines was rated under natural disease pressure in the field. Among 213 RFLP and 139 microsatellite markers surveyed, 88 (41{\%}) and 90 (65{\%}) markers, respectively, detected polymorphism between Becker and Massey. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) was used to facilitate the identification of molecular markers associated with APR to powdery mildew. Three quantitative trait loci (QTLs), designated as QPm.vt-1B, QPm.vt-2A, and QPm.vt-2B, were identified with interval mapping. They are located on wheat chromosomes 1B, 2A, and 2B, and, respectively, explained 17, 29, and 11{\%} of the total variation of F2:3 lines for powdery mildew resistance. The three QTLs associated with APR to powdery mildew were derived from Massey, and displayed additive gene action. QPm.vt-2B also fits a recessive model for APR to powdery mildew. In a multi-QTL model, the three QTLs explained 50{\%} of the total variation of F2:3 lines for APR to powdery mildew. The presence of the three QTLs was confirmed with 97 recombinant inbred (RI) lines, tested for APR to powdery mildew under natural powdery mildew pressure over 3 yr (F5:6–F7:8 generation). The molecular markers identified in this study have potential for use in marker-assisted selection and pyramiding of genes for resistance to powdery mildew.},

Percentage infected grains and frequency of different Fusarium species was analysed in every grain sample. The effect of fungicides, glyphosate and postemergence herbicides on Fusarium grain infection was studied. Significant increase in Fusarium infection was detected in fungicide-treated plots compared with untreated plots. Fusarium avenaceum and F. tricinctum were the most frequent species detected.

Odour as a parameter of differentiation can also be used to determine the state of health of crops, although this is not favourable when dealing with detecting plant disease that may pose health threats to human beings. In addition to these, human experts may take years of training and can be inconsistent, as well as prone to fatigue. This paper presents a work conducted on utilising an electronic nose incorporating artificial intelligence to detect plant disease, specifically basal stem rot (BSR) disease that is caused by Ganoderma boninense fungus affecting oil palm plantations in South East Asia. This study used a commercially available electronic nose, Cyranose 320, as the front end sensors and artificial neural networks for pattern recognition. The odour samples were captured on site at Besout oil palm plantation, Perak, Malaysia, and the classification performed on a PC. The results showed that the system was able to differentiate healthy and infected oil palm tree using different odour parameters with a high rate of accuracy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Dothistroma needle blight, caused by the fungus Dothistroma septosporum, is a major past of pine plantations in the Southern Hemisphere, where both the host and the pathogen have been introduced. In northern temperate forests where the pest and host trees are native, damage levels have historically been low; however, Dothistroma is currently causing extensive defoliation and mortality in plantations of lodgepole pine in northwestern British Columbia, Canada. The severity of the disease is such that mature lodgepole pine trees in the area are succumbing, which is an unprecedented occurrence. This raises the question of whether climate change might enable the spread of the disease by surpassing an environmental threshold that has previously restricted the pathogen's development in northern temperate regions. Establishing a causal relationship between climate change and local biological trends is usually difficult, but we found a clear mechanistic relationship between an observed climate trend and the host-pathogcn interaction. A local increase in summer precipitation, not climate warming, appears to be responsible. We examine whether the recently observed climate change trend exceeds natural fluctuations in the local climate.},

abstract = {Maize is by quantity the most important C4 cereal crop; however, future climate changes are expected to increase maize susceptibility to mycotoxigenic fungal pathogens and reduce productivity. While rising atmospheric [CO2] is a driving force behind the warmer temperatures and drought, which aggravate fungal disease and mycotoxin accumulation, our understanding of how elevated [CO2] will effect maize defences against such pathogens is limited. Here we report that elevated [CO2] increases maize susceptibility to Fusarium verticillioides proliferation, while mycotoxin levels are unaltered. Fumonisin production is not proportional to the increase in F. verticillioides biomass, and the amount of fumonisin produced per unit pathogen is reduced at elevated [CO2]. Following F. verticillioides stalk inoculation, the accumulation of sugars, free fatty acids, lipoxygenase (LOX) transcripts, phytohormones and downstream phytoalexins is dampened in maize grown at elevated [CO2]. The attenuation of maize 13-LOXs and jasmonic acid production correlates with reduced terpenoid phytoalexins and increased susceptibility. Furthermore, the attenuated induction of 9-LOXs, which have been suggested to stimulate mycotoxin biosynthesis, is consistent with reduced fumonisin per unit fungal biomass at elevated [CO2]. Our findings suggest that elevated [CO2] will compromise maize LOX-dependent signalling, which will influence the interactions between maize and mycotoxigenic fungi.},

abstract = {Stripe rust (yellow rust) of wheat, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, has become more severe in eastern United States, Australia, and elsewhere since 2000. Recent research has shown that this coincided with a global spread of two closely related strains that were similar based on virulence phenotype and amplified fragment length polymorphism. The objective of this research was to quantify differences in aggressiveness among isolates representative of the pre-2000 and post-2000 populations. Representative isolates were evaluated at low (10 to 18 degrees C) and high (12 to 28 degrees C) temperature regimes for latent period, lesion length, lesion width, lesion area, and spore production on adult plants of a susceptible wheat cultivar with no known genes for resistance to stripe rust. "New" isolates (since 2000) were significantly more aggressive than "old" isolates (before 2000) for all variables. At the low temperature regime, new isolates sporulated 2.1 days (16{\%}) sooner, grew 0.3 mm per day (18{\%}) faster, produced 999 (140{\%}) more spores per inoculation site per day, and produced 6.5 (71{\%}) more spores per mm(2) of lesion per day compared with old isolates. At the high temperature regime, new isolates sporulated 3 days (26{\%}) sooner, grew 0.2 mm per day (18{\%}) and 2.2 mm(2) per day (88{\%}) faster, grew 1.2 mm (50{\%}) wider, produced 774 (370{\%}) more spores per inoculation site per day, and produced 6.2 (159{\%}) more spores per mm(2) of lesion per day than old isolates. New isolates showed significant adaptation to the warm temperature regime for all variables. Based on these results and previously published models for stripe rust epidemics, recent severe stripe rust epidemics were most likely enhanced by the pathogen's increased aggressiveness, especially at higher temperature. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that wheat rust fungi can adapt to warmer temperatures and cause severe disease in previously unfavorable environments.},

In situations with unfavorable weather for late blight, the DSS recommended fewer fungicide applications with no loss of disease suppression; and, in situations of very favorable weather for late blight, the DSS recommended more fungicide applications but with improved disease suppression. Field evaluation was conducted in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. All experiments involved at least two cultivars with different levels of resistance. DSS-guided and weekly scheduled fungicide treatments were successful at protecting against late blight in all field experiments. As expected, DSS-guided schedules were influenced by prevailing weather (observed and forecast) and host resistance and resulted in schedules that maintained or improved disease suppression and average fungicide use efficiency relative to calendar-based applications. The DSS provides an interactive system that helps users maximize the efficiency of their crop protection strategy by enabling well-informed decisions.},

abstract = {This paper reports the effect of twice-ambient (700 ppm) atmospheric CO2 concentration on infection, disease development, spore production and dispersal of the anthracnose pathogen Colletotrichum gloeosporioides in susceptible (Fitzroy) and partially resistant (Seca) cultivars of the tropical pasture legume Stylosanthes scabra under controlled environment and field conditions. Reduction in plant height due to anthracnose was partially compensated for by growth enhancement at elevated CO2 in Fitzroy but not in Seca. Anthracnose severity was reduced under elevated CO2 although the reduction was only significant in Fitzroy. Delayed and reduced germination, germtube growth and appressoria production were partly responsible for the reduced severity. Despite an extended incubation period, C. gloeosporioides developed sporulating lesions faster and produced more spores per day within the same latent period at high CO2 and ambient CO2. When Fitzroy seedlings grown at 700 ppm CO2 were exposed to pathogen inoculum under field conditions, they consistently developed more severe anthracnose with more lesions than seedlings grown at ambient CO2. The environmental variable, which correlated most strongly with the dispersal and infection of C. gloeosporioides spores in the field, was relative humidity in plant canopy. We have shown that an enlarged Stylosanthes canopy under elevated CO2 can trap more spores, which can lead to more severe anthracnose under favorable weather. The implications of these findings for perennial Stylosanthes pastures are discussed.},

abstract = {Fusarium graminearum causes head blight (FHB) and crown rot (CR) diseases in wheat. Compared with FHB, CR symptom development occurs slowly, usually taking 4 to 8 weeks to become visible. To characterize CR development, we used histological and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses to assess fungal colonization during a timecourse of infection. Three distinct phases of infection were identified: i) initial spore germination with formation of a superficial hyphal mat at the inoculation point, ii) colonization of the adaxial epidermis of the outer leaf sheath and mycelial growth from the inoculation point to the crown, concomitant with a drop in fungal biomass, and iii) extensive colonization of the internal crown tissue. Fungal gene expression was examined during each phase using Affymetrix GeneChips. In total, 1,839 F. graminearum genes were significantly upregulated, including some known FHB virulence genes (e.g., TRI5 and TRI14), and 2,649 genes were significantly downregulated in planta compared with axenically cultured mycelia. Global comparisons of fungal gene expression with published data for FHB showed significant similarities between early stages of FHB and CR. These results indicate that CR disease development involves distinct phases of colonization, each of which is associated with a different fungal gene expression program.},

Data from 120 primary, peer-reviewed articles describing physiology and production in the 12 large-scale FACE experiments (475-600 ppm) were collected and summarized using meta-analytic techniques. The results confirm some results from previous chamber experiments: light-saturated carbon uptake, diurnal C assimilation, growth and above-ground production increased, while specific leaf area and stomatal conductance decreased in elevated [CO(2)]. There were differences in FACE. Trees were more responsive than herbaceous species to elevated [CO(2)]. Grain crop yields increased far less than anticipated from prior enclosure studies. The broad direction of change in photosynthesis and production in elevated [CO(2)] may be similar in FACE and enclosure studies, but there are major quantitative differences: trees were more responsive than other functional types; C(4) species showed little response; and the reduction in plant nitrogen was small and largely accounted for by decreased Rubisco. The results from this review may provide the most plausible estimates of how plants in their native environments and field-grown crops will respond to rising atmospheric [CO(2)]; but even with FACE there are limitations, which are also discussed.},

abstract = {Fusarium crown rot (FCR) is a major disease of wheat and barley, and stem-base browning has been routinely used to measure resistance. Compared with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) shows less severe FCR stem-base browning symptoms (indicative of greater resistance or tolerance) but suffers higher yield loss (indicative of greater susceptibility), whereas durum wheat (T. durum Desf.) shows similar FCR severity but suffers much worse yield loss. To understand these differences, fungal biomass in bread and durum wheats and barley was estimated by real-time quantitative PCR at different stages of FCR disease development. Similar to a previous report on bread wheat infection by Fusarium graminearum, FCR infection caused by Fusarium pseudograminearum also showed three distinct phases in each of the three crop species analysed. During all stages of FCR disease development, barley varieties invariably displayed earlier and faster fungal accumulation compared with either bread or durum wheat. Although suffering much greater yield loss than barley, durum wheat appears to accumulate significantly lower levels of F. pseodugraminearum during infection. These results demonstrate that bread wheat varieties are more resistant to FCR infection and pathogen accumulation than barley varieties, and the less yield loss of the latter is likely due to its better tolerance to this disease. If also existing among different sources of resistance within a given species, these different features of disease resistance and tolerance could be exploited to minimize yield loss of new varieties.},

abstract = {Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) has been used as a model organism to develop and test important ecological and evolutionary concepts and is also a major pest of grain and grain products globally. This beetle species is assumed to be a good colonizer of grain storages through anthropogenic movement of grain, and active dispersal by flight is considered unlikely. Studies using T. castaneum have therefore used confined or walking insects. We combine an ecological study of dispersal with an analysis of gene flow using microsatellites to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics and adult flight of T. castaneum in an ecological landscape in eastern Australia. Flying beetles were caught in traps at grain storages and in fields at least 1 km from the nearest stored grain at regular intervals for an entire year. Significantly more beetles were trapped at storages than in fields, and almost no beetles were caught in native vegetation reserves many kilometres from the nearest stored grain. Genetic differentiation between beetles caught at storages and in fields was low, indicating that although T. castaneum is predominantly aggregated around grain storages, active dispersal takes place to the extent that significant gene flow occurs between them, mitigating founder effects and genetic drift. By combining ecological and molecular techniques, we reveal much higher levels of active dispersal through adult flight in T. castaneum than previously thought. We conclude that the implications of adult flight to previous and future studies on this model organism warrant consideration.},

abstract = {During last years, public health surveillance has been facilitated by the existence of several packages implementing statistical methods for the analysis of spatial and spatio-temporal disease data. However, these methods are still inaccesible for many health researchers lacking the adequate statistical and programming skills to effectively use the required software. In this paper we present SpatialEpiApp, a Shiny web application that integrates two of the most common approaches for health surveillance: disease mapping and detection of clusters. SpatialEpiApp is easy to use and does not require any programming knowledge. Given information about the cases, population and optionally covariates for each of the areas and dates of study, the application allows to fit Bayesian disease models to obtain disease risk estimates and their uncertainty for each of the areas and dates by using INLA, and to detect spatial and spatio-temporal disease clusters by using the scan statistics implemented in SaTScan. The application allows user interaction and the creation of interactive data visualizations and reports showing the analyses performed.},

abstract = {The global impact of an increased concentration of CO(2) in the atmosphere on plants has been studied extensively, but little information has been published on the effect of enrichment of atmospheric CO(2) on the nutritive value of grain and straw used as ruminant feeds. This paper reports the chemical composition and nutritive value of grain and straw harvested from the drought tolerant hard red spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L) variety Yecora Rojo managed with two carbon dioxide regimes (ambient, 350 mu l/l and elevated, 550 mu l/l), two rates of nitrogen application (low N: 53 kg N/ha and high N: 393 kg N/ha) grown under a water-fed (i.e., no deficit) regime. Accumulation of carbon in straw did not differ among crops grown under elevated CO(2) and low N supplementation and crops grown under ambient CO(2) with low levels of N supplementation. Increased N application increased sequestration of C (P{\textless}0.05) compared to straw from crops grown under ambient CO(2) concentration. Low levels of N application and elevated CO(2) led to straw containing similar concentrations of N to those grown under ambient CO(2) conditions. Increasing N application to crops grown Under ambient concentrations of CO(2) elevated the concentration of N (P{\textless}0.01) whereas crops at elevated concentrations of CO(2) did not accumulate N to the same extent. Differences in the non-structural carbohydrate and cell wall content reflected lie patterns for total C. No effect of increasing the concentration of CO(2) on WSC, aNDF(om), ADF(om), hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin (sa) occurred. There was a small decline (-26 g/kg; P{\textless}0.05) in the concentration of aNDF(om) in straw from crops that had received high N input, The ratio of lignin to total N was higher in straw harvested from plots with elevated CO (33.5:1) compared with ambient CO(2) (24.6:1). No changes in the total C content occurred for grain samples in response to CO(2) concentration or supplemental N fertiliser. No interaction between supply of N and CO(2) concentration occurred. Changes in the total N content of grain in response to treatments were similar to the changes observed in the straw fraction. The increases in concentration of N incorporated into grain were higher from crops grown under enriched concentrations of CO(2) (ie., +8.6 g/kg; P{\textless}0.01) than for crops grown tinder ambient supply of CO; (+3.5 g/kg; P{\textless}0.05). Differences in concentration of starch in the grain with increasing supply of N from fertiliser occurred tinder FACE conditions (P{\textless}0.05), but not for grain harvested from those grown under ambient CO(2) levels. No effect of changing concentrations Of CO(2) were observed for ADF(om), lignin (sa), cellulose and neutral detergent cellulose digestibility but concentrations of aNDF(om) (P{\textless}0.05) and hemicellulose (P{\textless}0.05) were higher in grain grown under ambient concentrations of CO(2) irrespective or supply of N to the crop. Although effects of elevated concentrations or CO(2) on grain and straw quality were expected, this poses concerns for livestock production in systems that use lower levels of agronomic inputs. Elevated concentrations of CO(2) in the ambient environment were beneficial for development of above ground biomass and grain yield as measured by thousand grain weight. However, straw and grain quality, in terms of crude protein and the crude protein to energy ratio wil be affected by increasing concentrations of CO(2) in the atmosphere, and this may lead to a reduction in the total Supply Of Crude protein in crops used by livestock.

abstract = {Histopathological assessment of infection by the crown rot pathogen Fusarium pseudograminearum in wheat seedling tissues was performed using fluorescence microscopy. The coleoptiles and leaf sheaths of four host cultivars of differing susceptibility were examined. Leaf sheaths were most frequently penetrated via stomata, indicated by initial lesions forming at the guard cells. Internally, cell wall penetration was facilitated by penetration structures which appeared as hyphal swellings or septate foot-shaped appressoria. Colonization of leaf sheaths resulted in the re-emergence of hyphae from stomata on both surfaces of the sheath. These hyphae are hypothesized to have two major roles; first as exploratory hyphae for colonization of new tissues, and secondly as sites of profuse conidial production. The formation of conidia on the leaf sheath surface was only recorded on the most susceptible bread wheat genotype. No other major differences in host–pathogen interactions were observed among these cultivars. Almost all cell types in the leaf sheath tissues were extensively colonized, except for the vascular bundles and silica cells. This investigation provides the first comprehensive assessment of F. pseudograminearum infection structures and growth patterns during the infection of wheat seedlings.},

abstract = {Earth's climate is changing. Effects of climate change on fungal distribution and activity are hard to predict because they are mediated in many different ways, including: fungal physiology, reproduction and survival, host physiology, spatial and temporal distribution of hosts, resource availability and competition. Currently it is hard to monitor such effects on fungal mycelium in the field, but fruit bodies provide a useful surrogate. Here we review the effects of climate change on phenological changes in fungal fruiting and fruit body yield, and on fungal hosts and distribution, particularly of saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes. We report that fruiting phenology is changing in many European countries: on average, the fruiting season is extending, though for some species it is contracting; different species and ecological groups behave differently; time of fruiting depends on geographical location; some fungi now fruit early in the year as well as in autumn, and spring fruiting is getting earlier; some fungi appear to be changing hosts; fruit body yields vary dramatically from year to year; the amount, duration and frequency of fruiting are influenced by numerous environmental factors. We also consider difficulties in assessing phenological and distributional data, and provide suggestions for future research directions at the interface of laboratory experiments and field observations, including molecular approaches and monitoring systems.

abstract = {Research on impacts of climate change on plant diseases has been limited, with most work concentrating on the effects of a single atmospheric constituent or meteorological variable on the host, pathogen, or the interaction of the two under controlled conditions. Results indicate that climate change could alter stages and rates of development of the pathogen, modify host resistance, and result in changes in the physiology of host-pathogen interactions. The most likely consequences are shifts in the geographical distribution of host and pathogen and altered crop losses, caused in part by changes in the efficacy of control strategies. Recent developments in experimental and modeling techniques offer considerable promise for developing an improved capability for climate change impact assessment and mitigation. Compared with major technological, environmental, and socioeconomic changes affecting agricultural production during the next century, climate change may be less important; it will, however, add another layer of complexity and uncertainty onto a system that is already exceedingly difficult to manage on a sustainable basis. Intensified research on climate change-related issues could result in improved understanding and management of plant diseases in the face of current and future climate extremes.},

abstract = {Abstract Plant pathogens often respond sensitively to changes in their environmental conditions and consequently represent a potentially important ecological response to global change. Although several studies have considered the effects of increased temperature and CO2 concentrations on plant pathogen risk, the effects of changing precipitation regimes have drawn less attention. Many classes of plant pathogen, however, are sensitive to changes in the water potential of their local environment. This study applied existing ecohydrological frameworks to connect precipitation, soil, and host properties with scenarios of pathogen risk, focusing on two water-sensitive pathogens: Phytophthora cinnamomi and Botryosphaeria doithidea. Simple models were developed to link the dynamics of these pathogens to water potentials. Model results demonstrated that the risk of host plants being colonized by the pathogens varied sensitively with soil and climate. The model was used to predict the distribution of Phytophthora in Western Australia and the severity of disease in horticultural blueberry trials with variable irrigation rates, illustrating potential applications of the framework. Extending the modeling framework to include spatial variation in hydrology, epidemic progression, and feedbacks between pathogens and soil moisture conditions may be needed to reproduce detailed spatial patterns of disease. At regional scales, the proposed modeling approach provides a tractable framework for coupling climatic drivers to ecosystem response while accounting for the probabilistic and variable nature of disease.},

abstract = {A method for calculating the effect of disease control on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with wheat production, reported previously, was developed further to account for effects of disease control on the amount of fertilizer nitrogen (N) which should be applied and on changes in land use. Data from nine randomized and replicated field experiments from the UK and Denmark showed that the economic optimum N input to winter wheat was greater if diseases were controlled by fungicides, than for untreated wheat. The GHGs associated with this additional N largely negated the benefit to emissions per tonne of grain resulting from disease control. However, the mean grain yield obtained without fungicide treatment was 6.71 t ha(-1), compared to 8.88 t ha(-1) with fungicide treatment, if N input was optimal for each situation. In the absence of disease control by fungicides, and assuming that the optimum N rate was used, an additional 481 kha of wheat would be required to maintain UK wheat production at the current level. If the additional land area came from converting temperate grassland to arable production, the GHG emissions caused by ploughing grassland would cause emissions to rise from 503 to 713 kg CO(2)e per tonne of grain produced. This would result in an additional 3.15 Mt CO2e per year to produce the typical UK annual production of 15 Mt. This analysis reinforces the importance of winning the 'arms race' against pathogen evolution towards fungicide insensitivity and virulence.},

abstract = {Despite recent advances in remote sensing, one of the major constraints that still remains is collecting the ground data needed to calibrate and validate remote sensing algorithms at large spatial and temporal scales. This is particularly challenging when mapping continuous variables such as yield, where calibration data often do not exist at the field-scale and are difficult to obtain through visual interpretation of high-resolution imagery. While crop cut estimates of crop yield are widely used to calibrate satellite yield estimation models, these data are time and cost intensive to collect. In this study, we examine the ability of self-reported yield estimates, which are much faster and easier to collect at large scales, to train satellite yield estimation models. We assess the accuracy of self-reported yield data and identify whether it is possible to increase self-reported accuracy by providing more information to farmers about the study design and potential benefits. Our results showed that farmers' self-reported crop yields were not accurate, and that self-reported crop yields led to inaccurate satellite yield estimation models when used for calibration. We also found that providing more information to farmers about the study design and benefits of satellite yield estimation did not improve self-reported accuracy. These results suggest that even though self-reported yield estimates may be a faster and lower cost way to collect field-level yield estimates, they likely are not an adequate data source to train satellite yield prediction models and should be used with caution.},

abstract = {Climate change influences on pests and pathogens are mainly plant-mediated. Rising carbon dioxide and temperature and altered precipitation modifies plant growth and development with concomitant changes in canopy architecture, size, density, microclimate and the quantity of susceptible tissue. The modified host physiology and canopy microclimate at elevated carbon dioxide influences production, dispersal and survival of pathogen inoculum and feeding behaviour of insect pests. Elevated temperature accelerates plant growth and developmental rates to modify canopy architecture and pest and pathogen development. Altered precipitation affects canopy architecture through either drought or flooding stress with corresponding effects on pests and pathogens. But canopy-level interactions are largely ignored in epidemiology models used to project climate change impacts. Nevertheless, models based on rules of plant morphogenesis have been used to explore pest and pathogen dynamics and their trophic interactions under elevated carbon dioxide. The prospect of modifying canopy architecture for pest and disease management has also been raised. We offer a conceptual framework incorporating canopy characteristics in the traditional disease triangle concept to advance understanding of host-pathogen-environment interactions and explore how climate change may influence these interactions. From a review of recent literature we summarize interrelationships between canopy architecture of cultivated crops, pest and pathogen biology and climate change under four areas of research: (a) relationships between canopy architecture, microclimate and host-pathogen interaction; (b) effect of climate change related variables on canopy architecture; (c) development of pests and pathogens in modified canopy under climate change; and (d) pests and pathogen management under climate change.},

abstract = {Climate change in Australia is expected to influence crop growing conditions through direct increases in elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) and average temperature, and through increases in the variability of climate, with potential to increase the occurrence of abiotic stresses such as heat, drought, waterlogging, and salinity. Associated effects of climate change and higherCO(2) concentrations include impacts on the water-use efficiency of dryland and irrigated crop production, and potential effects on biosecurity, production, and quality of product via impacts on endemic and introduced pests and diseases, and tolerance to these challenges. Direct adaptation to these changes can occur through changes in crop, farm, and value-chain management and via economically driven, geographic shifts where different production systems operate. Within specific crops, a longer term adaptation is the breeding of new varieties that have an improved performance in 'future' growing conditions compared with existing varieties. In crops, breeding is an appropriate adaptation response where it complements management changes, or when the required management changes are too expensive or impractical. Breeding requires the assessment of genetic diversity for adaptation, and the selection and recombining of genetic resources into new varieties for production systems for projected future climate and atmospheric conditions. As in the past, an essential priority entering into a ` climate-changed' era will be breeding for resistance or tolerance to the effects of existing and new pests and diseases. Hence, research on the potential incidence and intensity of biotic stresses, and the opportunities for breeding solutions, is essential to prioritise investment, as the consequences could be catastrophic. The values of breeding activities to adapt to the five major abiotic effects of climate change (heat, drought, waterlogging, salinity, and elevated CO2) are more difficult to rank, and vary with species and production area, with impacts on both yield and quality of product. Although there is a high likelihood of future increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and temperatures across Australia, there is uncertainty about the direction and magnitude of rainfall change, particularly in the northern farming regions. Consequently, the clearest opportunities for ` in-situ' genetic gains for abiotic stresses are in developing better adaptation to higher temperatures (e. g. control of phenological stage durations, and tolerance to stress) and, for C-3 species, in exploiting the (relatively small) fertilisation effects of elevated CO2. For most cultivated plant species, it remains to be demonstrated how much genetic variation exists for these traits and what value can be delivered via commercial varieties. Biotechnology-based breeding technologies (marker-assisted breeding and genetic modification) will be essential to accelerate genetic gain, but their application requires additional investment in the understanding, genetic characterisation, and phenotyping of complex adaptive traits for climate-change conditions.},

abstract = {A model-driven discovery process, Computing Life, is used to identify an ensemble of genetic networks that describe the biological clock. A clock mechanism involving the genes white-collar-1 and white-collar-2 (wc-1 and wc-2) that encode a transcriptional activator (as well as a blue-light receptor) and an oscillator frequency (frq) that encodes a cyclin that deactivates the activator is used to guide this discovery process through three cycles of microarray experiments. Central to this discovery process is a new methodology for the rational design of a Maximally Informative Next Experiment (MINE), based on the genetic network ensemble. In each experimentation cycle, the MINE approach is used to select the most informative new experiment in order to mine for clock-controlled genes, the outputs of the clock. As much as 25{\%} of the N. crassa transcriptome appears to be under clock-control. Clock outputs include genes with products in DNA metabolism, ribosome biogenesis in RNA metabolism, cell cycle, protein metabolism, transport, carbon metabolism, isoprenoid (including carotenoid) biosynthesis, development, and varied signaling processes. Genes under the transcription factor complex WCC ( = WC-1/WC-2) control were resolved into four classes, circadian only (612 genes), light-responsive only (396), both circadian and light-responsive (328), and neither circadian nor light-responsive (987). In each of three cycles of microarray experiments data support that wc-1 and wc-2 are auto-regulated by WCC. Among 11,000 N. crassa genes a total of 295 genes, including a large fraction of phosphatases/kinases, appear to be under the immediate control of the FRQ oscillator as validated by 4 independent microarray experiments. Ribosomal RNA processing and assembly rather than its transcription appears to be under clock control, suggesting a new mechanism for the post-transcriptional control of clock-controlled genes.},

abstract = {The fungus Fusarium graminearum is shown to have a wide host range on gramineous plants in Queensland. Isolates from hosts other than maize when inoculated onto wheat seed were capable of causing the disease known as crown rot in resulting plants. The same disease was reproduced by wheat isolates in other gramineous hosts including canary grass (Phalavis canariensis), barley, and rye but oats was only slightly susceptible. No symptoms typical of field infection could be reproduced in maize. Root rot occurred in linseed. The perfect state of the organism as it occurs in Queensland is described and identified as Gibberella zeae. This was reproduced experimentally, easily in the case of maize isolates but only with some difficulty with isolates from other hosts. The occurrence in Queensland of pathogenic races of Gibberella zeae is postulated. Crown rot of wheat caused by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe was first recorded in Queensland in 1951 and has been responsible for serious losses on the Darling Downs, the principal wheat-growing area of the State (McKnight and Hart 1966). Earlier records were made in 1917 of a head condition of wheat associated with an organism identified as Fusarium roseum (Tyron 1918). F, graminearum in its perfect form Gibberella zeae (Schw.) Petch has been recorded frequently on maize for many years (Simmonds 1966). In addition to wheat McKnight recorded F, graminearum associated with a crown rot condition of barley, oats, canary seed (Phalaris canariensis L.), Hordeum leporinum Link, Phalavis paradoxa L., and Panicum decompositum R. Br. (Simmonds 1966), while the author has recorded the disease on wild oats (Avena fatua L. and A. ludoviciana Dur.), Agropyron scabrum (Labill.) Beauv., Bromus unioloides H.B.K., Danthonia linkii Kunth, Dichanthium humilius J. M. Black, and Panicum queenslandicum Domin (Simmonds 1966, and unpublished records of Queensland Department of Primary Industries). F. graminearum has been recorded widely elsewhere on cereals causing head blight, seedling blight, and foot rot. These occurrences have been reviewed by Butler (1961) and recently Cook (1968) has described symptoms in Washington State, U.S.A. Maize and many grass hosts have also been recorded as hosts of the fungus elsewhere (Padwick 1935; Sprague 1950; Butler 1961).},

abstract = {The economical production of physiologically and behaviorally competent diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), is critical to most research and control programs against this insect. Although a few laboratory-adapted colonies are currently maintained on artificial diets, the establishment and adaptation of feral DBM onto semi-synthetic diets is often difficult. Understanding the interactions between insect strain and diet may be critical to the process of laboratory adaptation as well as to the successful use of laboratory-reared insects in the field. As such, the objective of this study was to investigate the interaction between several DBM colonies/strains and different natural and semi-synthetic diets. Specifically, we examined the effect of different diets on the length of development, percent survival, adult weight, female fecundity, and adult longevity for two feral and one laboratory-adapted strain of DBM. Significant interactions were observed between diet and laboratory-adapted and feral strains, and also between diet and different feral strains with respect to many of the growth and development parameters tested. Therefore, the performance of one strain of DBM on a particular diet was not necessarily predicted by the performance of another DBM strain on the same diet. However, the soy-based diet developed and reported herein performed well for all three DBM strains tested. In future efforts to colonize feral DBM, we suggest that researchers assay different diet formulations in order to identify a semi-synthetic diet that is most suitable for the particular DBM strain under consideration.},

Five lineages (A-E) were identified among 856 isolates. Of these, 12{\%} were strongly pathogenic on cotton, 10{\%} were weakly pathogenic and designated wild Fov, while 78{\%} were nonpathogenic. In contrast to the occurrence of pathogenic isolates in all five lineages in soils associated with wild Gossypium, in cotton growing areas only three lineages (A, B, E) occurred and all pathogenic isolates belonged to two subgroups in lineage A. One of these contained VCG 01111 isolates while the other contained VCG 01112 isolates. Sequence analyses of translation elongation factor-1$\alpha$, mitochondrial small subunit rDNA, nitrate reductase and phosphate permease confirmed that Australian Fov isolates were more closely related to lineage A isolates of native F. oxysporum than to Fov races 1-8 found overseas. These results strongly support a local evolutionary origin for Fov in Australian cotton growing regions. {\textcopyright} 2010 CSIRO.},

abstract = {Genetic variation among Australian isolates of the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), which causes Fusarium wilt in banana, was examined using DNA amplification fingerprinting (DAF). Ninety-four isolates which represented Races 1, 2, 3, and 4, and vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) 0120, 0124, 0125, 0128, 0129, 01211, 01213/16, and 01220 were analysed. The genetic relatedness among isolates within each VCG, and between the 8 different VCGs of Foc present in Australia was determined. The DNA fingerprint patterns were VCG-specific, with each VCG representing a unique genotype. The genetic similarity among isolates within each VCG ranged from 97{\%} to 100{\%}. Among the different VCGs of Foc, 3 major clusters were distinguished which corresponded with race. All Race 1 and 2 isolates (VCGs 0124, 0125, 0128, and 01220) were closely related and clustered together, the Race 3 isolates from Heliconia clustered separately, and all Race 4 isolates (VCGs 0120, 0129, 01211, and 01213/16) clustered together. Fifteen isolates from Alstonville, NSW, were characterised because although they were classified as Race 2 based on their recovery from cooking banana cultivars, they belonged in VCG 0124, which had previously contained only Race 1 isolates. The occurrence of more than one race within a VCG means that vegetative compatibility grouping cannot be used to assign pathotype to pathogenic race as previously thought. It was possible to distinguish the Race 1 and Race 2 isolates within VCG 0124 using DNA fingerprinting, as each race produced a unique DNA fingerprint pattern. Among the Australian isolates, DNA fingerprinting analysis identified 9 different VCGs and genotypes of Foc.},

abstract = {Wheat crops in southeast Queensland (Qld) and northern New South Wales (NSW) were infected with fusarium head blight (FHB)-like symptoms during the 201011 wheat growing season. Wheat crops in this region were surveyed at soft dough or early maturity stage to determine the distribution, severity, aetiology and toxigenicity of FHB. FHB was widespread on bread wheat and durum, and Fusarium graminearum and/or F.pseudograminearum were diagnosed from 42 of the 44 sites using species-specific PCR primers directly on spikelets or from monoconidial cultures obtained from spikelets. Stem base browning due to crown rot (CR) was also evident in some samples from both states. The overall FHB and CR severity was higher for NSW than Qld. Deoxynivalenol (DON) concentration of immature grains was more than 1 mg kg-1 in samples from 11 Qld and 14 NSW sites, but only 13 of 498 mature grain samples sourced from the affected areas had more than 1 mg kg-1 DON. DON concentration in straw also exceeded 1 mg kg-1 in eight Qld and all but one NSW sites but this was not linked to DON concentration of immature grains. The proportion of spikelets with positive diagnosis for F.graminearum and/or F.pseudograminearum and weather-related factors influenced DON levels in immature grains. The average monthly rainfall for AugustNovember during crop anthesis and maturation exceeded the long-term monthly average by 10150{\%}. Weather played a critical role in FHB epidemics for Qld sites but this was not apparent for the NSW sites, as weather was generally favourable at all sites.},

abstract = {Crown rot caused by Fusarium pseudograminearum and/or F. culmorum affects all winter-grown cereals in south-eastern Australia. Control of crown rot relies heavily on a break from cereals to decrease inoculum borne on plant residues in the soil. This study used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to measure the DNA of the crown rot pathogens in soil before and after cereal and non-cereal treatments in six field trials (four in Victoria, two in South Australia). Levels of F. pseudograminearum and F. culmorum DNA were highest after cereals (particularly durum and barley) and lowest after non-cereals (particularly field pea and fallow). F. pseudograminearum and F. culmorum generally responded to treatments in a similar manner. Some sites were more responsive to treatment than others, although the relative effects of the treatments were consistent at all sites. This study demonstrates that it is possible to decrease crown rot inoculum (and so decrease the risk of yield loss from this disease) by use of non-cereals in crop sequences. The potential for predicting the effect of a treatment on levels of Fusarium spp. DNA in soil is discussed.},

Durum wheat consistently increased levels of DNA for both Fusarium spp. more than commercial or breeding lines of bread wheat. This supports the finding of Wallwork et al. (2004) that durum is more susceptible to both F. pseudograminearum and F. culmorum than commercial or breeding lines of bread wheat. It also reinforces the importance of the role of durum wheat in causing large increases in crown rot inoculum within fields (Burgess et al. 2001).

After barley, which yields well in the presence of crown rot, and durum, which does not, there were similar levels of Fusarium spp. DNA. After bread wheat, which has intermediate yield losses from crown rot, there were lower levels of Fusarium spp. DNA than after barley and durum. This indicates that, when choosing cereal types, farmers must balance short-term yield gains against the longer term implications for losses from crown rot due to increased inoculum levels. Oats are usually a symptomless host (Nelson and Burgess 1995) but were considered by Wildermuth and Purss (1971) to be more resistant to crown rot than barley based on stem browning symptoms. In this study, levels of F. culmorumDNAwere similar after oats and barley, but levels of F. pseudograminearum DNA were lower after oats than after barley (Fig. 1).},

abstract = {Agricultural systems are increasingly managed for improving soil carbon (C) accumulation. However, there are limits to C returns in agricultural systems that constrain soil C accumulation capacity. Increasing the efficiency of how soil microbes process C is gaining interest as an important management strategy for increasing soil C and is a key feature of soil C dynamics in many new microbial-explicit models. A higher microbial C use efficiency (CUE) may increase C storage while reducing C system losses and is a fundamental trait affecting community assembly dynamics and nutrient cycling. However, the numerous ecological unknowns influencing CUE limit our ability to effectively manage CUE in agricultural soils for greater soil C storage. In this perspective, we consider three complex drivers of agroecosystem CUE that need to be resolved to develop effective C sequestration management practices in the future: 1) the environment as an individual trait moderator versus a filter, 2) microbial community competitive and faciliatory interactions, and 3) spatio-temporal dynamics through the soil profile and across the microbial lifecycle. We highlight ways that amendments, crop rotations, and tillage practices might affect microbial CUE conditions and the variable outcomes of these practices. We argue that to resolve some of the unknowns of CUE dynamics we need to include more mechanistic, trait-based approaches that capitalize on advanced methods and innovative field research designs within an agroecosystem specific context. By identifying the management-level determinants of CUE expression, we will be better positioned to optimize CUE to increase soil C storage in agricultural systems.},

At a planting depth of 6-7 cm, over half of the tissue area above the seed was infected while symptoms were visible on only 0-6{\%} of the tissue. Infection of wheat and barley by this pathogen in the greenhouse reduced the leaf area of plants at the two-leaf growth stage compared to noninfected plants. This likewise occurred prior to the appearance of disease symptoms. These observations may help explain why common root rot is associated primarily with reduced tillering even though severe symptoms only appear after tiller number is established. Early infections reduce leaf growth at a time when tiller number is being determined.},

abstract = {Two winter wheat varieties were grown in growth chambers under controlled environmental conditions at ambient (control) and doubled atmospheric CO2 concentrations (375 and 750 mumol mol(-1)). By heading, the plants of both varieties were taller in the doubled CO2 treatment, where among all the vegetal parts the largest increase (31-67 {\%}) was observed in the stem weight. The plants had higher aboveground biomass at high CO2 than at the ambient level, and also more spikes were found in both varieties at harvest, due to either increased tiller production with similar heading efficiency to the control, or a more modest rise in the tiller number accompanied by improved heading efficiency resulting in 19 {\%} fewer sterile tillers. As there were no significant changes in the number of grains and the grain weight per spike at elevated CO2, the increase in the yield could only be attributed to the increase in the spike number, though in one variety it remained below the level of significance. Heading started later at elevated CO2, as the plants produced the main spike 1.5-3.5 days later than in the control. However, the plants of one variety produced the second spike much faster (2.7 days after the main spike, compared to 5.1 in the control) at high CO2, While in the other variety the subsequent spikes appeared in a similar chronological order to the ambient CO2 level. These findings imply that, despite the delaying impact of high CO2 on the heading date, the plants might compensate by the faster production of further spikes, leading to a synchronisation of spike emergence.},

abstract = {Host plant resistance offers an attractive method of control for early blight (caused by the foliar fungus Alternaria solani), a widespread disease that appears annually in potato crops worldwide. We tested the assumed ability of taxonomy to predict the presence of early blight resistance genes in wild Solanum species for which resistance was observed in related species. We also tested associations to ploidy, crossing group, breeding system, and geography. As in a prior study of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (white mold) resistance, tremendous variation for resistance to early blight was found to occur within and among species. There was no discernable relationship between the distribution of resistant phenotypes and taxonomic series (based on an intuitive interpretation of morphological data), clade (based on a cladistic analysis of plastid DNA data), ploidy, breeding system, geographic distance, or climate parameters. Species and individual accessions with high proportions of early blight resistant plants were identified, but high levels of inter- and intra-accession variability were observed. Consequently, the designation of species or accessions as resistant or susceptible must take this variation into account. This study calls into question the assumption that taxonomic or geographic data can be used to predict sources of early blight resistance in wild Solanum species.},

abstract = {Seedling stand, disease severity and fungal incidence were determined from untreated 'Wakefield' soft red winter wheat planted on a Leeper silty clay loam in field tests conducted at the Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station, Plant Science Research Center, Mississippi State University, Starkville, Mississippi during the 1996201397 and 1997201398 growing seasons. Seedling stand was reduced by 40{\%} each year in plots established with untreated seed. Cochliobolus sativus was the most frequently isolated fungus. Fusarium acuminatum, Fusarium equiseti and Fusarium solani were the most prevalent Fusarium spp. Seven other Fusarium spp. and 23 species of other fungal genera were isolated. Pathogenicity tests with three isolates each of C. sativus, Cochliobolus spicifer, F. acuminatum, F. solani, F. equiseti, Fusarium compactum, Embellisia chlamydospora and Microdochium bolleyi were performed in test tube culture and two isolates each of C. sativus, C. spicifer, F. acuminatum, E. chlamydospora and M. bolleyi under greenhouse conditions. In test tubes and in the greenhouse, seedlings infected with isolates of C. sativus developed seedling blight, discoloration and necrosis, primarily in seminal roots and crowns. In the greenhouse, C. sativus induced lesions on the lower leaf sheath and reduced seedling height, seedling emergence, dry and fresh weight of roots and shoots. Isolates of F. acuminatum, F. solani, F. equiseti, F. compactum, E. chlamydospora and M. bolleyi induced slight to moderate orange to light-brown discoloration of crown and seminal roots in test tubes. Cochliobolus spicifer isolates had the most pre-emergence activity, inducing black root discoloration and root pruning of wheat seedlings and reducing seedling emergence, root fresh weight and shoot dry weight. In the greenhouse, F. acuminatum reduced seedling height, seedling emergence and root and shoot dry weights. Microdochium bolleyi and E. chlamydospora reduced fresh and dry weight of roots, plant emergence and shoot dry weight. Fusarium acuminatum and C. spicifer reduced the growth rate of wheat seedlings. All fungi evaluated showed increased disease severity compared to the untreated control. The high frequency of isolation of C. sativus from crown and root tissues can be partially explained by the dry, warm conditions during the early stages of wheat seedling development in the Upper Coastal Plain Land Resource Area of Mississippi.

abstract = {Despite being closely related to Fusarium graminearum, which has been extensively characterized in many countries around the world, the population biology of Fusarium pseudograminearum, the main causal agent of crown rot of wheat in Australia and many other wheat-growing regions, has been comparatively poorly studied to date. A simple sequence repeat analysis of 163 F. pseudograminearum isolates from three field sites in NSW, Australia identified 128 distinct multilocus genotypes. Observed genetic diversity within fields was high, whilst genetic variation between fields was low. Across all fields genetic linkage disequilibrium was detected, but of the three individual fields, only one also displayed linkage disequilibrium. These results indicate that the isolates obtained were part of the same, highly diverse, population. However, this population may not be freely interbreeding. Whilst isolation incidence of F. pseudograminearum was found to be spatially aggregated within fields, spatial aggregation of genotypes within fields was weak. The study suggests that processes influencing population dynamics may operate at a scale larger than the narrow geographical scale covered in the fields sampled.},

Crown rot has gained greater importance in the USA through recent reports suggesting that commercial winter wheat fields in the Pacific North-West could have their grain yield reduced by up to 35{\%} by crown rot (Smiley et al., 2005b). In the same region, field inoculation with F. pseudograminearum demonstrated potential yield losses up to 61{\%} greater than those caused by the native pathogen flora (Smiley et al., 2005b).
Another key characteristic differentiating F. pseudograminearum from F.graminearum is its heterothallic mating system (Aoki {\&} O'Donnell, 1999b). Individuals possess only one of two mating-type idiomorphs (MAT1-1 or MAT1-2) within their genome (Bentley et al., 2008a)},

The objective of this study was to isolate a wide variety of melanised root-associated fungi within the Sydney basin (NSW, Australia) and assess growth response of Trifolium subterraneum to inoculation with individual isolates. Of 902 root-associated fungi isolated from plant roots, 118 were melanised. All but two of these fungi were re-isolated from inoculated T. subterraneum seedlings after 7 weeks in a controlled environment. Approximately 60 {\%} of the melanised root-associated fungi did not reduce plant growth. Twenty-four isolates tended to increase plant growth and were tentatively identified as predominantly ascomycetes, and one zygomycete. Melanised root-associated fungi appeared to form complex interactions with T. subterraneum, the natures of which remain to be further explored. Melanised root-associated fungi could potentially play key ecological roles including positively influencing edaphic conditions.},

@article{Wu2014,
abstract = {ABSTRACT Verticillium wilt, caused by Verticillium dahliae, is a destructive disease in lettuce, and the pathogen is seedborne. Even though maximum seed infestation rates of {\textless}5{\%} have been detected in commercial lettuce seed lots, it is necessary to establish acceptable contamination thresholds to prevent introduction and establishment of the pathogen in lettuce production fields. However, introduction of inoculum into lettuce fields for experimental purposes to determine its long term effects is undesirable. Therefore, we constructed a simulation model to study the spread of Verticillium wilt following pathogen introduction from seed. The model consists of four components: the first for simulating infection of host plants, the second for simulating reproduction of microsclerotia on diseased plants, the third for simulating the survival of microsclerotia, and the fourth for simulating the dispersal of microsclerotia. The simulation results demonstrated that the inoculum density-disease incidence curve parameters and the dispersal gradients affect disease spread in the field. Although a steep dispersal gradient facilitated the establishment of the disease in a new field with a low inoculum density, a long-tail gradient allowed microsclerotia to be dispersed over greater distances, promoting the disease spread in fields with high inoculum density. The simulation results also revealed the importance of avoiding successive lettuce crops in the same field, reducing survival rate of microsclerotia between crops, and the need for breeding resistance against V. dahliae in lettuce cultivars to lower the number of microsclerotia formed on each diseased plant. The simulation results, however, suggested that, even with a low seed infestation rate, the pathogen would eventually become established if susceptible lettuce cultivars were grown consecutively in the same field for many years. A threshold for seed infestation can be established only when two of the three drivers of the disease-(i) low microsclerotia production per diseased plant, (ii) long-tail dispersal gradient, and (iii) low microsclerotia survival between lettuce crops-are present.},

abstract = {Climate change effects on Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lactucae (FOL) on lettuce plants grown under simulated climate change were studied. An artificial growing substrate was infested with FOL to reach a final concentration of 1×104 CFUg-1 of substrate. A non infested tank was used as control.Subsequently, 32 pots (2l each) were prepared from the infested tank and other 32 pots were prepared from the non infested tank (control). Lettuce plants were then transplanted into the pots and grown in phytotrons under four simulated environmental conditions: (1) 800ppm CO2, 22-26°C; (2) 800ppm CO2, 18-22°C; (3) 400ppm CO2, 22-26°C and (4) 400ppm CO2, 18-22°C. Substrate samples were collected from each phytotron at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after transplanting. Plate counts, enzymatic assays, and polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of climate change on the microbial population. The abundance of Fusarium spp. and the severity of Fusarium wilt of lettuce varied significantly as a consequence of increased temperature (22-26°C). Increased CO2 levels showed no effect on the severity of Fusarium wilt of lettuce and on the abundance of Fusarium spp. On the other hand, the total bacterial abundance was reduced at elevated CO2 concentration (800ppm). PCR-DGGE fingerprints of the ascomycete community obtained from DNA directly extracted from infested substrate samples did not change as a consequence of elevated temperature and CO2.Enzymatic activities were not affected by the elevated CO2 level. Our study indicates that the CO2 concentration used in our experiment had no detectable impact on Fusarium wilt of lettuce. Only temperature influenced all observed parameters, but did not affect the fungal species diversity. Other factors, such as nutrient limitation and the effect of plant species needs further study. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Studied apiarieswere evenly distributed across five sites located in continental France. Beeswax samples were collected once a year over 2 years from a total of 125 honey bee colonies.Multiresidue analyses were performed on these samples in order to identify residues of 16 insecticides and acaricides and two fungicides. Residues of 14 of the searched-for compounds were found in samples. Tau-fluvalinate, coumaphos and endosulfan residues were the most frequently occurring residues (61.9, 52.2 and 23.4{\%} of samples respectively). Coumaphos was found in the highest average quantities (792.6 µgkg−1). Residues of cypermethrin, lindane and deltamethrin were found in 21.9, 4.3 and 2.4{\%} of samples respectively. Statistical tests showed no difference between years of sampling, with the exception of the frequency of pyrethroid residues.

abstract = {The total size of the world population is likely to increase from its current 7 billion to 8–10 billion by 2050. This uncertainty is because of unknown future fertility and mortality trends in different parts of the world. But the young age structure of the population and the fact that in much of Africa and Western Asia, fertility is still very high makes an increase by at least one more billion almost certain. Virtually, all the increase will happen in the developing world. For the second half of the century, population stabilization and the onset of a decline are likely. In addition to the future size of the population, its distribution by age, sex, level of educational attainment and place of residence are of specific importance for studying future food security. The paper provides a detailed discussion of different relevant dimensions in population projections and an evaluation of the methods and assumptions used in current global population projections and in particular those produced by the United Nations and by IIASA.},

abstract = {Plant-pathogenic fungi produce an array of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes that enable them to penetrate and infect the host tissue; these enzymes are collectively called cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDE). They may contribute to pathogenesis by degrading wax, cuticle and cell walls, thus aiding tissue invasion and pathogen dissemination. Furthermore, they can act as elicitors of host defense reaction.Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a disease caused principally by Fusarium graminearum on crops, occurring all over the world. Important economic losses on wheat-growing areas have been registered by altering quality parameters of grains. Significant progress has been made in understanding the infection process from F. graminearum on wheat, based on genomic technologies. The virulence degree of this phytopathogen on crops could arise from differences in the production of extracellular enzymes, factors controlling the establishment of infection.Fusarium graminearum isolates from different geographical areas have been examined, and a combination of morphological and molecular data allowed the division of fungi in diverse groups, which have been related to the variation in pathogenicity. In most studied cases there is a correlation between the presence of pectic enzymes, disease symptom and virulence, being also their production decisive in the infection process.

The importance of lipases for phytopathogenicity has been shown for Alternaria brassicicola [10], Botrytis cinerea [18], and F. graminearum [26, 46},

abstract = {Senescence is a highly regulated developmental process that has some overlap with response to pathogen stress. Many senescence-associated genes (SAGs) play an important role in pathogenic fungi defence, although their exact function remains unclear. We previously identified a stripe rust pathogen-induced up-regulated EST (EL773044) from the suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH)-cDNA library of wheat cultivar Shaanmai 139 that was induced by Puccinia striiformis West (Pst) race CYR 32. To further understand the role of SAGs in wheat defence, a wheat SAG orthologue was identified and characterised, and was named TaSAG 120 (GenBank: JN558557). The cDNA consisted of 1040 nucleotides and contained an open reading frame of 384 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 127 amino acids. The estimated molecular weight was 14.1 kDa with a pI of 9.56. A hydrophobic region was observed at positions 56-75 in the amino acid sequence. Using DNA from nulli-tetrasomic lines and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers based on related Triticum sequences, PCR results showed that TaSAG 120 is a multi-copy gene without introns. Transcriptome analysis indicated that TaSAG 120 was involved in plant defence against Puccinia striiformis West infection. However, TaSAG expression in immune incompatible interactions was lower than that in the compatible interactions 1-3 days post-inoculation with Pst CYR 32 in hexaploid wheat. This implied that TaSAG is a negative indicator linked to the level or capacity of plant defences against pathogen infection. Fluctuations in the extent of TaSAG expression as a result of pathogen challenge in immune resistant wheat may play a crucial role in translating the induced modulations into a pathogen-defence response.},

abstract = {Geographic distributions of pathogens are the outcome of dynamic processes involving host availability, susceptibility and abundance, suitability of climate conditions, and historical contingency including evolutionary change. Distributions have changed fast and are changing fast in response to many factors, including climatic change. The response time of arable agriculture is intrinsically fast, but perennial crops and especially forests are unlikely to adapt easily. Predictions of many of the variables needed to predict changes in pathogen range are still rather uncertain, and their effects will be profoundly modified by changes elsewhere in the agricultural system, including both economic changes affecting growing systems and hosts and evolutionary changes in pathogens and hosts. Tools to predict changes based on environmental correlations depend on good primary data, which is often absent, and need to be checked against the historical record, which remains very poor for almost all pathogens. We argue that at present the uncertainty in predictions of change is so great that the important adaptive response is to monitor changes and to retain the capacity to innovate, both by access to economic capital with reasonably long-term rates of return and by retaining wide scientific expertise, including currently less fashionable specialisms.},
annote = {This article focuses heavily and in-depth over climate and pathogen modelling and the relavance. It also covers the usefulness of modeling under certain circumstances.

What can be usefully said about changes in geographic distribution as climate changes? In this paper, we argue that many pathogen distributions are already far from an equilibrium and may change rapidly in any case.

We develop our argument in three phases. 
The first phase begins by considering the population dynamical processes which set the geographic range of a pathogen. We continue by comparing the time-scales involved in practical decision making and in climate-induced changes in the geographic range of pathogens. We then discuss how adequate information about the current distributions of pathogens is, and what limits them.
In the second phase, we discuss methods for deducing how a pathogen's geographic range depends on environmental variables. We then introduce relevant aspects of current climate modelling capability, stressing the extent of between-model uncertainty. This serves as an introduction to discussion of some examples of detailed projection exercises which have been published. 
Finally, we try to answer the question posed above, showing how the answer may suggest specific policy options.

For example, in the early 1980s, net blotch caused by Pyrenophora teres became for a while the major problem in growing winter barley in southern
England (Jordan, 1981). This coincided with a simultaneous increase in frequency of minimum tillage, leading to much more efficient transfer from one season's crops to the next, and to the release of the cultivar Sonja, which was much more susceptible to the pathogen than previous cultivars (Jordan{\&}Allen, 1984). Similar examples could be given from all over the world: for example, the rise in coffee berry disease (Colletotrichum kahawae) in the mid-20th century in East Africa (Griffiths {\&} Waller, 1971), or the increased importance of maize streak disease in Zambia and Zimbabwe as irrigation led to year-round cultivation of maize (Rose, 1978).

The overwhelming importance of management and cultivar means that direct effects of climate change on components of the pathogen life-cycle will in fact be one of the more minor factors altering pathogen distributions on crops in the future; indirect effects on host susceptibility through changes in cultivar, management of area grown and types of land used are likely to be much more important (cf. Burdon et al., 2006).

It is possible to measure the population of a pathogen by counting infected units at any scale, either plants or patches. Whether a disease will persist in a population of the chosen units depends on the parameter R0, defined as the number of infected units produced over the lifetime of an infected unit in the absence of any other infection (Segarra et al., 2001).However, the conditions can be quite favourable, with R0{\textgreater}{\textgreater}1 in-field, and yet the disease not be endemic in a region, if the occurence of the host in the landscape and the conditions in the host-free season are unfavourable,

Relaxation time specifies the time-scale on which a system moves back to equilibrium after a disturbance.

Equivalently, the time-scale over which significant climate change is is expected (several decades) is longer than the time-scale over which cultivars are replaced by breeding and movement between growing areas (decades).

As with crops, therefore, pathogens are likely to remain limited by their host distributions, and not become disconnected from them. However, there is serious concern that climate zones will move faster than it is possible for plant populations to track them; this is especially a concern for local endemic species, which are likely to suffer disproportionate extinction (Loarie et al., 2009)

Factors involved in determining R0 and so the equilibrium distribution of a pathogen include host presence, phenology, resistance and agronomy, especially planting date in relation to season; chance; community structure, including the abundance and types of competitors, predators and alternative or alternate hosts; and finally climate – both frequency of conditions permitting infection, dispersal and rate of growth once in the host, and the severity of conditions in the off-season when the pathogen population is decreasing.

Of course, the expansion of trade means that many new linkage routes now exist, and one prediction that can be made with reasonable assurance is that invasions by diseases new to a region will remain common or become more frequent (MacLeod et al., 2010).},

abstract = {Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, the causal agent of fusarium wilt of banana (Musa spp.), is one of the most destructive strains of the vascular wilt fungus F. oxysporum. Genetic relatedness among and within vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense was studied by sequencing two nuclear and two mitochondrial DNA regions in a collection of 70 F. oxysporum isolates that include representatives of 20 VCGs of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense, other formae speciales, and nonpathogens. To determine the ability of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense to sexually recombine, crosses were made between isolates of opposite mating types. Phylogenetic analysis separated the F. oxysporum isolates into two clades and eight lineages. Phylogenetic relationships between F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense and other formae speciales of F. oxysporum and the relationships among VCGs and races of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense clearly showed that F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense's ability to cause disease on banana has emerged multiple times, independently, and that the ability to cause disease to a specific banana cultivar is also a polyphyletic trait. These analyses further suggest that both coevolution with the host and horizontal gene transfer may have played important roles in the evolutionary history of the pathogen. All examined isolates harbored one of the two mating-type idiomorphs, but never both, which suggests a heterothallic mating system should sexual reproduction occur. Although, no sexual structures were observed, some lineages of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense harbored MAT-1 and MAT-2 isolates, suggesting a potential that these lineages have a sexual origin that might be more recent than initially anticipated.},

They are naturally occurring, environmentally safe organisms that infect insects by contact. Insect fungal pathogens have a broad spectrum of hosts, can be mass-produced easily, rapidly and economically and can be applied with the same technical means as conventional contact insecticides. In this context, the most studied fungal species for the control of stored-product insect species are Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae. Both fungal species have a wide host range and have been tested against most of the major stored-product insect pests. The effect of biotic and abiotic factors on the virulence and success of ento-mopathogenic fungi in storage insect control, as well as the combined application of these agents with other pest con-trol technologies, is reviewed here. Temperature and rela-tive humidity influence the efficacy of entomopathogenic fungi, often with variable results, whereas the combined use of entomopathogenic fungi with diatomaceous earth in many cases has a synergistic or additive effect. Alternative methods of entomopathogenic fungi application, based on the lure-and-kill approach, are proposed, and future chal-lenges for the use of entomopathogenic fungi against stored-product insects are highlighted.},

abstract = {Soil borne pathogens (SBPs) including the Dryland Root Rots and Cereal Nematodes are causing economic yield loss in many parts of the world where cereals dominate the cropping system and sub-optimal growing conditions or cultural practices are common. One of the most effective control measures of these SBPs is the use of host resistance, whereby the inoculum level of these pathogens can be reduced to below economically damaging thresholds. CIMMYT International in collaboration with The Turkish Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs have established an International field and laboratory screening program for identifying spring and winter wheat accessions with resistance to SBPs. Several screening protocols for assessing resistance to both cereal root rots and nematodes have been modified and optimized. Known resistance sources to SBPs from other regions of the world have been tested against Turkish isolates of SBPs and several of these have been shown to be effective in the region. In addition new sources of resistance with genetic variability have been identified against the prevalent SBPs. These diverse genes for resistance are being pyramided into both spring and winter bread wheat backgrounds using both conventional and molecular tools where feasible.},

@article{Deller2011a,
abstract = {Significant progress has been made in elucidating the mechanisms used by plants to recognize pathogens and activate "immune" responses. A "first line" of defense can be triggered through recognition of conserved Pathogen or Microbe Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs or MAMPs), resulting in activation of basal (or non-host) plant defenses, referred to as PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). Disease resistance responses can also subsequently be triggered via gene-for-gene type interactions between pathogen avirulence effector genes and plant disease resistance genes (Avr-R), giving rise to effector triggered immunity (ETI). The majority of the conceptual advances in understanding these systems have been made using model systems, such as Arabidopsis, tobacco, or tomato in combination with biotrophic pathogens that colonize living plant tissues. In contrast, how these disease resistance mechanisms interact with non-biotrophic (hemibiotrophic or necrotrophic) fungal pathogens that thrive on dying host tissue during successful infection, is less clear. Several lines of recent evidence have begun to suggest that these organisms may actually exploit components of plant immunity in order to infect, successfully colonize and reproduce within host tissues. One underlying mechanism for this strategy has been proposed, which has been referred to as effector triggered susceptibility (ETS). This review aims to highlight the complexity of interactions between plant recognition and defense activation towards non-biotrophic pathogens, with particular emphasis on three important fungal diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum) leaves.

abstract = {The control of highly infectious diseases of agricultural and plantation crops and livestock represents a key challenge in epidemiological and ecological modelling, with implemented control strategies often being controversial. Mathematical models, including the spatio-temporal stochastic models considered here, are playing an increasing role in the design of control as agencies seek to strengthen the evidence on which selected strategies are based. Here, we investigate a general approach to informing the choice of control strategies using spatio-temporal models within the Bayesian framework. We illustrate the approach for the case of strategies based on pre-emptive removal of individual hosts. For an exemplar model, using simulated data and historic data on an epidemic of Asiatic citrus canker in Florida, we assess a range of measures for prioritizing individuals for removal that take account of observations of an emerging epidemic. These measures are based on the potential infection hazard a host poses to susceptible individuals (hazard), the likelihood of infection of a host (risk) and a measure that combines both the hazard and risk (threat). We find that the threat measure typically leads to the most effective control strategies particularly for clustered epidemics when resources are scarce. The extension of the methods to a range of other settings is discussed. A key feature of the approach is the use of functional-model representations of the epidemic model to couple epidemic trajectories under different control strategies. This induces strong positive correlations between the epidemic outcomes under the respective controls, serving to reduce both the variance of the difference in outcomes and, consequently, the need for extensive simulation.},

Differences were found to be significant (p {\textless} 0.01) for all the characters. The significance of additive components (D) and dominant components (H1, H2) demonstrated the importance of both additive and dominance effects for all traits. The greater value of D over H1 and H2 demonstrated the additive nature of genes for all traits, which suggested the utilization of pedigree and full/sib selection for improvement of these parameters. All traits exhibited high narrow and broad sense heritability. Graphical representation demonstrated in DIC recessive alleles and in DSV, FDK, DI and ISK dominant alleles led to decreasing level of traits and increasing resistance to FHB.},

@article{Lakhesar2010a,
abstract = {Displacement of pathogenic Fusarium species from cereal residues by other fungi is an important mechanism for the effectiveness of fallows and crop rotations on disease management, as well as in potential biological control. The effect of fluctuating environmental conditions on the rate of displacement was assessed using two different approaches. In the first, wetness durations between 4 and 10 h were simulated by spraying water onto straw inoculated with Fusarium pseudograminearum and antagonists in a greenhouse. For a given cumulative period of wetness, displacement of F. pseudograminearum was generally higher for short (4 h) than longer (10 h) wetting durations, indicating that it was the number of wetting events, rather than their individual durations, that determined the rate of displacement. In the second approach, exponential decay models using thermal time adjusted for rainfall were fitted to published data on survival of Fusarium species in residues. Heat sums calculated from the mean temperature of days on which rain fell, or rainday-degrees (RDD), gave good fits to data from short-term experiments on displacement of F. pseudograminearum by antagonists under natural conditions. RDD and two other indices, decomposition days (DCD) and corrected degree-days (CDD), were equally satisfactory for modelling straw decomposition and mortality of Fusarium in longer term data sets. Such models could be useful for predicting the effects of environmental variation on rotations and biocontrol for Fusarium management in cereals.},

abstract = {Atmospheric CO2 concentration (C-a) continues to rise. An imperative exists, therefore, to elucidate the interactive effects of elevated C-a and drought on plant water relations of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). A spring wheat (cv. Yecora Rojo) crop was exposed to ambient (Control: 370 mu mol mol(-1)) and free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE: ambient + 180 mu mol mol(-1)) under ample (Wet), and reduced (Dry), water supplies (100 and 541{\%} replacement of evapotranspiration, respectively) over a 2-yr study. Our objective was to characterize and quantify the responses of 26 edaphic, gas exchange, water relations, carbohydrate pool dynamics, growth, and development parameters to rising C-a and drought. Increasing C-a minimized the deleterious effects of soil-water depiction by increasing drought avoidance (i.e., lower stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, and growth and development of a more robust root system) and drought tolerance (i.e., enhanced osmoregulation and adaptation of tissue) mechanisms, resulting in a 30{\%} reduction in water stress-induced midafternoon depressions in net assimilation rate. An elevated C-a-based increase in daily and seasonal carbon gain resulted in a positive feedback between source capacity (shoots) and sink demand (roots). Devoid of a concomitant rise in global temperature resulting from the rise in C-a, improved water relations for a herbaceous, cool-season, annual, C-3 cereal monocot grass (i.e., wheat) are anticipated in a future high-CO2 world. These findings are applicable to other graminaceous species of a similar function-type as wheat common to temperate zone grassland prairies and savannas, especially tinder dryland conditions.},

abstract = {Spatial patterns of pathogen inoculum in field soils and the resulting patterns of disease may reflect the underlying mechanisms of pathogen dispersal. This knowledge can be used to design more efficient sampling schemes for assessing diseases. Spatial patterns of Verticillium dahliae microsclerotia were characterized in commercial cotton fields through quadrat and point sampling in 1994 and 2013, respectively. Furthermore, cotton plants with wilt symptoms, caused by V. dahliae, were assessed in six commercial cotton fields in 2013. Soil samples were assayed for the density of microsclerotia (expressed as CFU g-1 of soil) using a wet-sieving plating method and a real-time quantitative PCR method for the 1994 and 2013 study, respectively. The estimated inoculum threshold for causing wilt development on individual plants varied with the three fields: ca. 1.6 CFU g-1 of soil for one field, and 7.2 CFU g-1 of soil for the other two. Both quadrat and point sampling spatial analyses showed that aggregation of V. dahliae inoculum in soils was usually not detected beyond 1.0 m. Similarly, the spatial patterns of wilted cotton plants indicated that spatial aggregation of diseased plants were only observed below the scale of 1.0 m in six commercial cotton plantations. Therefore, spatial aggregation of both V. dahliae inoculum and cotton plants with wilt symptoms is not likely to be detected above the scale of 1.0 m for most commercial cotton plantations. When designing schemes for assessing wilt inoculum and wilt development, this scale needs to be taken into consideration.},

abstract = {Mungbean (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek) in Australia has been transformed from a niche opportunistic crop into a major summer cropping option for dryland growers in the summer-dominant rainfall regions of Queensland and New South Wales. This transformation followed stepwise genetic improvements in both grain yields and disease resistance. For example, more recent cultivars such as ‘Crystal', ‘Satin II', and ‘Jade-AU‘have provided up to a 20{\%} yield advantage over initial introductions. Improved agronomic management to enable mechanised management and cultivation in narrow ({\textless}50 cm) rows has further promised to increase yields. Nevertheless, average yields achieved by growers for their mungbean crops remain less than 1 t/ha, and are much more variable than other broad acre crops. Further increases in yield and crop resilience in mungbean are vital. In this review, opportunities to improve mungbean productivity have been analysed at four key levels including phenology, leaf area development, dry matter accumulation, and its partitioning into grain yield. Improving the prediction of phenology in mungbean may provide further scope for genetic improvements that better match crop duration to the characteristics of target environments. There is also scope to improve grain yields by increasing dry matter production through the development of more efficient leaf canopies. This may introduce additional production risks as dry matter production depends on the amount of available water, which varies considerably within and across growing regions in Australia. Improving crop yields by exploiting G × E × M interactions related to cultivar photo-thermal sensitivities and make better use of available water in these variable environments is likely to be a less risky strategy. Improved characterisation of growing environments using modelling approaches could also better define and identify the risks of major abiotic constraints. This would assist in optimising breeding and management strategies to increase grain yield and crop resilience in mungbean for the benefit of growers and the industry.},

abstract = {Mungbean (Vigna radiata L.), as a dryland grain legume, is exposed to varying timing and severity of water deficit, which results in variability in grain yield, nitrogen accumulation and grain quality. In this field study, mungbean crops were exposed to varying timing and severity of water deficit in order to examine: (1) contribution of the second flush of pods to final grain yield with variable timing of relief from water deficit, (2) the sensitivity to water deficit of the accumulation of biomass and nitrogen (N) and its partitioning to grain, and (3) how the timing of water deficit affects the pattern of harvest index (HI) increase through pod filling. The results showed that the contribution of the second flush to final yield is highly variable (1-56{\%}) and can be considerable, especially where mid-season stress is relieved at early pod filling. The capacity to produce a second flush of pods did not compensate fully for yield reduction due to water stress. Relief from mid-season stress also resulted in continued leaf production, N2 fixation and vegetative biomass accumulation during pod filling. Despite the wide variation in the degree of change in vegetative biomass and N during pod filling, there were strong relationships between grain yield and net-above-ground biomass at maturity, and grain N and above-ground N at maturity. Only in the extreme situations were HI and nitrogen HI affected noticeably. In those treatments where there was a large second flush of pods, there was a pronounced biphasic pattern to pod number production, with HI also progressing through two distinct phases of increase separated by a plateau. The proportion of grain yield contributed to by biomass produced before pod filling varied from 0 to 61{\%} with the contribution greatest under terminal water deficit. There was a larger effect of water deficit on N accumulation, and hence N2 fixation, than on biomass accumulation. The study confirmed the applicability of a number of long-standing physiological concepts to the analysis of the effect of water deficit on mungbean, but also highlighted the difficulty of accounting for timing effects of water deficit where second flushes of pods alter canopy development, biomass and yield accumulation, and N dynamics.

abstract = {Meta-analysis, the methodology for analyzing the results from multiple independent studies, has grown tremendously in popularity over the last four decades. Although most meta-analyses involve a single effect size (summary result, such as a treatment difference) from each study, there are often multiple treatments of interest across the network of studies in the analysis. Multi-treatment (or network) meta-analysis can be used for simultaneously analyzing the results from all the treatments. However, the methodology is considerably more complicated than for the analysis of a single effect size, and there have not been adequate explanations of the approach for agricultural investigations. We review the methods and models for conducting a network meta-analysis based on frequentist statistical principles, and demonstrate the procedures using a published multi-treatment plant pathology data set. A major advantage of network meta-analysis is that correlations of estimated treatment effects are automatically taken into account when an appropriate model is used. Moreover, treatment comparisons may be possible in a network meta-analysis that are not possible in a single study because all treatments of interest may not be included in any given study. We review several models that consider the study effect as either fixed or random, and show how to interpret model-fitting output. We further show how to model the effect of moderator variables (study-level characteristics) on treatment effects, and present one approach to test for the consistency of treatment effects across the network. Online supplemental files give explanations on fitting the network meta-analytical models using SAS.},

abstract = {The aim of this analysis was to estimate the effect sizes and consistency of products evaluated for fire blight control in the eastern United States over the last decade. Because only 3{\%} of the 69 studies published from 2000 to 2008 explicitly presented a measure of within-study variability, a method for estimating the least significant difference (LSD) and, hence the sampling variance, for studies with at least two significant mean separations in the presented mean multiple comparisons was developed. Lin's concordance analysis indicated that the estimated LSD was an accurate predictor of the actual LSD based on 35 studies in a calibration evaluation ($\rho$(c) = 0.997). Separate multi-treatment random-effects meta-analyses were performed for three control categories: antibiotics, biological control, and plant defense-activating products and mean log response ratios relative to the nontreated controls ([Formula: see text]) were computed for each treatment and then back-transformed to obtain the mean percent disease control. None of the products evaluated performed as well as streptomycin, the standard product for fire blight control, for which the mean disease control was 68.6{\%}. As a group, experimental antibiotics provided the best fire blight control with mean effect sizes ranging from 59.7 to 61.7{\%}. Among the biological controls, the best control was noted for treatments combining the antibiotic streptomycin with a product based on Pantoea agglomerans (55.0{\%} mean disease reduction) or Bacillus subtilis (53.9{\%}). Mean disease control was 31.9, 25.7, and 22.6{\%}, respectively, for products based on B. subtilis, Pantoea agglomerans, and Pseudomonas fluorescens without an antibiotic, suggesting that the higher efficacy of the combination treatments was due to the antibiotic. Among the plant defense-activating products, prohexadione calcium had the highest and most consistent effect size (50.7{\%} control), while other products provided modest mean disease control of between 6.1 and 25.8{\%}. Percent control values were significantly moderated by study location and cultivar used in the study, and were smaller, but more variable, when products were tested under high disease intensity compared with low disease intensity. Results indicate that wide-scale use of biological control and plant defense-activating products in the eastern United States is likely to remain low.},

A multivariate random-effects meta-analytical model was fitted to the log-transformed treatment means from over 100 uniform fungicide studies across 11 years and 14 states, and the mean log ratio (relative to the untreated check or tebuconazole mean) was determined as the overall effect size for quantifying fungicide efficacy. Mean log ratios were then transformed to estimate mean percent reduction in IND and DON relative to the untreated check (percent control: C(IND) and C(DON)) and relative to tebuconazole. All fungicides led to a significant reduction in IND and DON (P {\textless} 0.001), although there was substantial between-study variability. Prothioconazole+tebuconazole was the most effective fungicide for IND, with a C(IND) of 52{\%}, followed by metconazole (50{\%}), prothioconazole (48{\%}), tebuconazole (40{\%}), and propiconazole (32{\%}). For DON, metconazole was the most effective treatment, with a [Formula: see text](DON) of 45{\%}; prothioconazole+tebuconazole and prothioconazole showed similar efficacy, with C(DON) values of 42 and 43{\%}, respectively; tebuconazole and propiconazole were the least effective, with C(DON) values of 23 and 12{\%}, respectively. All fungicides, with the exception of propiconazole, were significantly more effective than tebuconazole for control of both IND and DON (P {\textless} 0.001). Relative to tebuconazole, prothioconazole, metconazole, and tebuconzole+prothioconzole reduced disease index a further 14 to 20{\%} and DON a further 25 to 29{\%}. In general, fungicide efficacy was significantly higher for spring wheat than for soft winter wheat studies; depending on the fungicide, the difference in percent control between spring and soft winter wheat was 5 to 20{\%} for C(IND) and 7 to 16{\%} for C(DON). Based on the mean log ratios and between-study variances, the probability that IND or DON in a treated plot from a randomly selected study was lower than that in the check by a fixed margin was determined, which confirmed the superior efficacy of prothioconazole, metconazole, and tebuconzole+prothioconzole for Fusarium head blight disease and toxin control.},

A quantitative review of tebuconazole effect on Fusarium head blight and deoxynivalenol content in wheat. Phytopathology 97:211-220. A meta-analysis of the effect of tebuconazole (e.g., Folicur 3.6F) on Fusarium head blight and deoxynivalenol (DON) content of wheat grain was performed using data collected from uniform fungicide trials (UFTs) conducted at multiple locations across U.S. wheat-growing regions. Response ratios (mean disease and DON levels from tebuconazole-treated plots, divided by mean disease and DON levels from untreated check plots) were calculated for each of 139 studies for tebuconazole effect on Fusarium head blight index (IND; field or plot-level disease severity, i.e., mean proportion of diseased spikelets per spike) and 101 studies for tebuconazole effect on DON contamination of harvested grain. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed on the log-transformed ratios, and the estimated mean log ratios were transformed to estimate the mean (expected) percent control for IND (IND C) and DON (DON C). A mixed-effects meta-analysis was then done to determine the effects of wheat type (spring versus winter wheat) and disease and DON levels in the controls on the log ratios. Tebuconazole was more effective at limiting IND than DON, with IND C and DON C values of 40.3 and 21.6{\%}, respectively. The efficacy of tebuconazole as determined by the impact on both IND and DON was greater in spring wheat than in winter wheat (P {\textless} 0.01), with a 13.2{\%} higher IND C and a 12.4{\%} higher DON C in spring wheat than in winter wheat. In general, IND C and DON C were both at their lowest values (and not significantly different from 0) when mean IND and DON in the controls, respectively, were low (≤2{\%} for IND and {\textless}1 ppm for DON). IND C was 25{\%} higher in studies with mean IND between 2 and 15{\%} than in studies with mean IND ≤ 2{\%}, whereas DON C was 28.8{\%} higher in studies with mean DON between 1 and 10 ppm than in studies with mean DON {\textless} 1 ppm. The between-study variance was significantly greater than 0 (P {\textless} 0.01), indicating considerable (unexplained) variability in percent control.},

abstract = {Meta-analysis is the analysis of the results of multiple studies, which is typically performed in order to synthesize evidence from many possible sources in a formal probabilistic manner. In a simple sense, the outcome of each study becomes a single observation in the meta-analysis of all available studies. The methodology was developed originally in the social sciences by Smith, Glass, Rosenthal, Hunter, and Schmidt, based on earlier pioneering contributions in statistics by Fisher, Pearson, Yates, and Cochran, but this approach to research synthesis has now been embraced within many scientific disciplines. However, only a handful of articles have been published in plant pathology and related fields utilizing meta-analysis. After reviewing basic concepts and approaches, methods for estimating parameters and interpreting results are shown. The advantages of meta-analysis are presented in terms of prediction and risk analysis, and the high statistical power that can be achieved for detecting significant effects of treatments or significant relationships between variables. Based on power considerations, the fallacy of na{\"{i}}ve counting of P values in a narrative review is demonstrated. Although there are many advantages to meta-analysis, results can be biased if the analysis is based on a nonrepresentative sample of study outcomes. Therefore, novel approaches for characterizing the upper bound on the bias are discussed, in order to show the robustness of meta-analysis to possible violation of assumptions. {\textcopyright} 2011 The American Phytopathological Society.},

abstract = {The extent of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis partly determines the difficulty in drawing overall conclusions. This extent may be measured by estimating a between-study variance, but interpretation is then specific to a particular treatment effect metric. A test for the existence of heterogeneity exists, but depends on the number of studies in the meta-analysis. We develop measures of the impact of heterogeneity on a meta-analysis, from mathematical criteria, that are independent of the number of studies and the treatment effect metric. We derive and propose three suitable statistics: H is the square root of the X2 heterogeneity statistic divided by its degrees of freedom; R is the ratio of the standard error of the underlying mean from a random effects meta-analysis to the standard error of a fixed effect meta-analytic estimate, and I2 is a transformation of H that describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity. We discuss interpretation, interval estimates and other properties of these measures and examine them in five example data sets showing different amounts of heterogeneity. We conclude that H and I2, which can usually be calculated for published meta-analyses, are particularly useful summaries of the impact of heterogeneity. One or both should be presented in published meta-analyses in preference to the test for heterogeneity. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2002 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Our objective was to identify weather-based variables in pre- and post- anthesis time windows for predicting major Fusarium head blight (FHB) epidemics (defined as FHB severity ? 10{\%}) in the United States. A binary indicator of major epidemics for 527 unique observations (31{\%} of which were major epidemics) was linked to 380 predictor variables summarizing temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall in 5-, 7-, 10-, 14-, or 15-day- long windows either pre- or post-anthesis. Logistic regression models were built with a training data set (70{\%} of the 527 observations) using the leaps-and-bounds algorithm, coupled with bootstrap variable and model selection methods. Misclassification rates were estimated on the training and remaining (test) data. The predictive performance of models with indicator variables for cultivar resistance, wheat type (spring or winter), and corn residue presence was improved by adding up to four weather- based predictors. Because weather variables were intercorrelated, no single model or subset of predictor variables was best based on accuracy, model fit, and complexity. Weather-based predictors in the 15 final em- pirical models selected were all derivatives of relative humidity or tem- perature, except for one rainfall-based predictor, suggesting that relative humidity was better at characterizing moisture effects on FHB than other variables. The average test misclassification rate of the final models was 19{\%} lower than that of models currently used in a national FHB pre- diction system. Additional},

abstract = {Decreased fungicidal control of powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca fuliginea (Schlecht: Fr.) Poll.) in commercial cucurbit crops led to an investigation to determine whether fungicide resistant strains were present. In field trials, fungicides such as bupirimate (100 mg a.i. L-1), dimethirimol (250 mg a.i. L-1), fenarimol (36 mg a.i. L-1), penconazole (40 mg a.i. L-l) and triadimefon (125 mg a.i. L-1) were less effective (P=0.01) in controlling the disease than oxythioquinox (100 mg a.i. L-1). This disagreed with earlier trial results and suggested that fungicide resistant strains may have developed. The sensitiyities of 6 isolates of S. fuliginea to 12 fungicides were determined using a leaf disc technique. Two isolates collected in fields where fungicides had been used intensively showed reduced sensitivity to fungicides from several chemical groups including the ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors, hydroxypyrimidines, organophosphates and benzimidazoles. Several spraying strategies were compared. The S. fuliginea populations receiving spray schedules which included the protectant fungicide oxythioquinox alone, or in alternation with a systemic (triadimefon) developed a lower proportion (66-73{\%}) of resistant strains than those treated with systemic fungicide alone (89{\%}). These findings suggest that S. fuliginea can develop strains with low sensitivity to several fungicides against powdery mildew. To prolong their efficacy, systemic fungicides should not be used continuously but should be reserved for use during the latter part of crop growth when disease risk is highest. Alternating or tank mixing with an effective protectant fungicide is also recommended. {\textcopyright} 1988 CSIRO. All rights reserved.},
