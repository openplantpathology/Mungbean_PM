It is worth noting Professor Malcolm Riley’s and Dr Sue Thompson’s effort in establishing and coordinating early field trials between 2010 and 2016. Studies were conducted in the following locations and years and were considered for inclusion in this analysis. 2001 Bongeen #1 Bongeen #2 2002 Hermitage #1 Hermitage #2 Kingaroy 2004 Redvale 2010 Hermitage Kingaroy 2011 Hermitage Kingaroy 2012 Gatton Kingaroy 2013 Premer Millmerran Marys Mount Goolhi 2015 Hermitage Dalby - Site abandoned due to insufficient/late disease infection Emerald 2016 Hermitage Kingaroy Emerald 2017 Missen Flats (Fogerty’s farm) Hermitage 2018 Wellcamp 2019 Hermitage 2001 - 2004 trials Trial data were obtained from a non-published manuscript. Ratings for powdery mildew were on a 1-5 rating scale and can be read in the file “Powdery mildew paper#1.doc”. Comparing trials, which have not used the same rating scale will be done using a percentage change. 2013 Field trials Trials were conducted by the Northern Growers Alliance (NGA). The raw data were obtained from Lawrie Price. NGA data were formatted to be compliant with existing data rating and scales using the R script R/Cleaning historical data.R. 2.1 Summary of data (#tab:data_summary)Description of Experiments trial_ref year location mean_treat_replicates planting_date first_sign_disease treatments mung0001/01 2001 Bongeen_1 5.000 2001-02-11 2001-03-16 7 mung0102/01 2002 Bongeen_2 3.000 NA 2002-02-07 12 mung0102/02 2002 Hermitage 3.462 2002-01-29 2002-03-19 13 mung0102/03 2002 Hermitage 3.462 2002-02-12 2002-04-04 13 mung0102/04 2002 Kingaroy 8.000 2002-02-12 2002-04-05 3 mung0304/01 2002 Redvale 7.000 2004-02-21 2004-03-23 3 mung0910/01 2010 Hermitage 3.000 2010-01-22 2010-03-18 15 mung0910/02 2010 Kingaroy 3.000 2010-01-29 2010-03-26 15 mung1011/01 2011 Hermitage 3.500 2011-01-24 2011-03-28 12 mung1011/02 2011 Kingaroy 6.000 2011-02-02 2011-03-22 20 mung1112/01 2012 Gatton 3.000 2012-02-20 2012-04-02 15 mung1112/02 2012 Kingaroy 3.000 2012-02-03 2012-03-12 15 AM1303 2013 Premer 3.000 2012-12-28 2013-02-28 11 AM1304 2013 Marys Mount 3.818 2012-12-24 2013-03-16 11 AM1305 2013 Goolhi 4.000 2013-01-23 2013-03-25 11 BB1305 2013 Millmerran 4.000 2013-01-12 2013-03-13 11 mung1415/01 2015 Hermitage 5.000 2015-01-19 2015-03-16 6 mung1415/02 2015 Dalby 5.000 2015-01-06 2015-03-02 1 mung1516/01 2016 Hermitage 4.000 2016-02-03 2016-03-08 7 mung1516/02 2016 Kingaroy 4.000 2016-02-11 2016-03-09 7 mung1516/03 2016 Emerald 4.000 2016-02-12 2016-03-17 7 mung1617/01 2017 Hermitage 3.000 2017-02-13 2017-03-24 54 mung1617/02 2017 Missen Flats 3.000 2017-01-27 2017-03-07 54 mung1718/01 2018 Wellcamp 3.000 2018-02-13 2018-03-21 24 mung1819/01 2019 Hermitage 6.000 2018-02-04 2018-04-12 4 mung1819/02 2019 Hermitage 5.500 2018-02-18 2018-04-12 4 2.2 Powdery mildew ratings No powdery mildew colonies observed on any plant Small colonies in lower 1/3 of canopy, up to 75% of plants affected Colonies in lower 1/2 of canopy, &gt;75% of plants affected Colonies in lower 2/3 of canopy, up to 75% of plants affected Colonies in lower 2/3 of canopy, &gt;75% of plants affected Colonies in lower 2/3 of canopy, 100% of plants affected Colonies in lower 2/3 of canopy of 100% of plants, some plants with colonies also in top 1/3 of canopy Colonies to top of plant with &gt;75% of plants affected Colonies to top of plant with 100% of plants affected and heavy leaf drop 2.3 Experiment locations The following map displays experiment locations where data was sufficient to include in this meta-analysis.
