Sparks 17 July, 2020 1 Home This research compendium details the statistical analysis and methods of a meta-analysis of fungicide efficacy trials for controlling powdery mildew in mungbean. The meta-analysisâ€™s main aim is to determine: When is the optimum time to spray fungicide to limit the effect of powdery mildew on mungbean yields? 1.1 Contents This compendium is broken down into seven sections: [Details of the experiments, which were included in the analysis][Studies considered in meta-analysis] [Preliminary data exploration which investigates possible variables that could influence the meta-analysis][Preliminary Analysis] [Fungicides][Fungicides] [Mungbean cultivar][Mungbean cultivars] [Row spacing][Row spacing] [Rainfall][Yield vs in-season rain] [When conditions become suitable for powdery mildew infection][Season range and first incidence] [Preparation of data for the meta-analysis][Prepare data for meta-analysis] [Meta-analysis of the effect of fungicide spray schedule on yield loss][Meta-analysis] [Meta-analysis of the effect of fungicide spray schedule on disease severity and yield loss][AUPDC meta-analysis] [Manuscript Wireframe][Manuscript wire frame] [Manuscript: A meta-analysis of fungicide use in mungbean to control for yield loss due to powdery mildew.][Manuscript] 1.2 Other research questions, which are not the focus of this study How has the first sign of powdery mildew changed between the seasons and experimental sites? Is there an ideal planting time, or fungicide management strategy, which could make use of powdery mildew defoliation during pod maturation resulting in an increased yield? Do infections that occur before flowering increase the probable yield loss? 1.3 Possible sources of variation in this analysis. Variability among host genotypes. The probable influence of season might be influenced by host genotype. This is because newer varieties were adopted into experimental trials as they were released. Between 2001 and 2015 mungbean genotype changed from Green Diamond, Berken, Crystal to Jade. Jade was the only cultivar used between 2015 and 2019. Estimations of plant maturity stages over each growing season. These estimations might able to be computed using APSIM. "]
