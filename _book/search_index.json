It is worth noting in particular Professor Malcolm Riley’s and Dr. Sue Thompson’s effort in establishing and coordinating early field trials between 2010 and 2016. Studies were conducted in the following locations and years and were considered for inclusion in this analysis. 2001 Bongeen #1 Bongeen #2 2002 Hermitage #1 Hermitage #2 Kingaroy 2004 Redvale 2010 Hermitage Kingaroy 2011 Hermitage Kingaroy 2012 Gatton Kingaroy 2013 Premer Millmerran Marys Mount Goolhi 2015 Hermitage Dalby - Site abandoned due to insufficient/late disease infection Emerald 2016 Hermitage Kingaroy Emerald 2017 Missen Flats (Fogerty’s farm) Hermitage 2018 Wellcamp 2019 Hermitage 2.1 Summary of trials (#tab:data_summary)Description of Experiments Year Location Replicates per treatments Planting date First sign of disease Fungicide treatments 2001 Bongeen_1 5 2001-02-11 2001-03-16 7 2002 Bongeen_2 3 NA 2002-02-07 12 2002 Hermitage 3 - 6 2002-01-29 2002-03-19 13 2002 Hermitage 3 - 6 2002-02-12 2002-04-04 13 2002 Kingaroy 8 2002-02-12 2002-04-05 3 2002 Redvale 7 2004-02-21 2004-03-23 3 2010 Hermitage 3 2010-01-22 2010-03-18 15 2010 Kingaroy 3 2010-01-29 2010-03-26 15 2011 Hermitage 3 - 6 2011-01-24 2011-03-28 12 2011 Kingaroy 6 2011-02-02 2011-03-22 20 2012 Gatton 3 2012-02-20 2012-04-02 15 2012 Kingaroy 3 2012-02-03 2012-03-12 15 2013 Premer 3 2012-12-28 2013-02-28 11 2013 Marys Mount 3 - 4 2012-12-24 2013-03-16 11 2013 Goolhi 4 2013-01-23 2013-03-25 11 2013 Millmerran 4 2013-01-12 2013-03-13 11 2015 Hermitage 5 2015-01-19 2015-03-16 6 2015 Dalby 5 2015-01-06 2015-03-02 1 2016 Hermitage 4 2016-02-03 2016-03-08 7 2016 Kingaroy 4 2016-02-11 2016-03-09 7 2016 Emerald 4 2016-02-12 2016-03-17 7 2017 Hermitage 3 2017-02-13 2017-03-24 54 2017 Missen Flats 3 2017-01-27 2017-03-07 54 2018 Wellcamp 3 2018-02-13 2018-03-21 24 2019 Hermitage 6 2018-02-04 2018-04-12 4 2019 Hermitage 5 - 6 2018-02-18 2018-04-12 4 2.2 Powdery mildew rating scales 2001 - 2004 trials Trial data were obtained from a non-published manuscript. 2.2.1 1 - 5 powdery mildew rating scale Ratings for powdery mildew were on a 1 - 5 rating scale where 1 - No sign of disease 2 - 1 - 30 % diseased leaf area 3 - 31 - 65 % diseased leaf area 4 - 66 - 99 % diseased leaf area and 5 - Complete defoliation Comparing these trials which have not used the 1 - 9 rating scale will be converted using a percentage change. 2013 Field trials Trials from 2013 were all conducted by the Northern Growers Alliance (NGA). The raw data were obtained from Lawrie Price. NGA data were formatted to be compliant with the 1 - 9 rating scale used in all other experiments. Detailed code for the conversion can be found in the following vignette 191115_PMMB_DataWrangling_PM.Rmd. 2.2.2 1 - 9 powdery mildew rating scale 1 - No powdery mildew colonies observed on any plant 2 - Small colonies in lower 1/3 of canopy, up to 75 % of plants affected 3 - Colonies in lower 1/2 of canopy, &gt;75 % of plants affected 4 - Colonies in lower 2/3 of canopy, up to 7 5% of plants affected 5 - Colonies in lower 2/3 of canopy, &gt;75 % of plants affected 6 - Colonies in lower 2/3 of canopy, 100 % of plants affected 7 - Colonies in lower 2/3 of canopy of 10 0% of plants, some plants with colonies also in top 1/3 of canopy 8 - Colonies to top of plant with &gt;75 % of plants affected 9 - Colonies to top of plant with 100 % of plants affected and heavy leaf drop 2.3 Experiment locations The following map displays experiment locations which were considered for inclusion in this meta-analysis.
