Which spray management scenario provides the greatest yield protection from powdery mildew. To do this, in our model: Grain yield is our response variable (t / ha) Trial, which resolves combinations of categorical variables: year, location, row spacing, fungicide dose and cultivar; is set as a random intercept We will test spray management (our treatment) as a fixed effect and random interactive term to trial First, how well does the data compare across the trial years and trials? # class spray_management as a factor and reorder them for the plot slimmer_PM_dat$spray_management &lt;- factor(slimmer_PM_dat$spray_management, rev( c( &quot;control&quot;, &quot;Early&quot;, &quot;Recommended&quot;, &quot;Recommended_plus&quot;, &quot;Late&quot;, &quot;Late_plus&quot; ) )) ggplot(slimmer_PM_dat, aes(x = as.factor(year), fill = spray_management)) + geom_bar(position = &quot;dodge2&quot;) + scale_fill_usq(name = &quot;Spray Management&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Year&quot;) kable( table(slimmer_PM_dat$spray_management, slimmer_PM_dat$year), align = rep(&#39;c&#39;, 8), caption = &quot;Which treatments and how many treatments are represented in each year&quot; ) %&gt;% kable_styling( &quot;striped&quot;, fixed_thead = TRUE, full_width = FALSE, position = &quot;center&quot; ) (#tab:table_of_nTreatments)Which treatments and how many treatments are represented in each year 2011 2012 2013 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Late_plus 0 0 0 1 7 0 12 0 Late 0 0 0 1 2 12 0 2 Recommended_plus 2 6 6 1 5 24 0 2 Recommended 4 6 3 1 4 12 0 2 Early 0 0 1 0 0 12 0 0 control 4 2 4 1 3 18 6 2 Treatments Late_plus and Early don’t have very good comparison to other treatments. Let’s visualise the spread of data in each treatments with box-plots. slimmer_PM_dat %&gt;% ggplot( aes( y = grain_yield.t.ha, x = spray_management, fill = spray_management, colour = spray_management ) ) + geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.25) + geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.5) + labs(x = &quot;Spray management variable&quot;, y = &quot;Grain yield (t/Ha)&quot;, title = &quot;Mean grain yield from each treatment \\n categorised by spray management scenario&quot;) + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 2) + scale_fill_usq() + scale_colour_usq() + coord_flip() + guides(fill = FALSE, color = FALSE) There seems like little difference between the treatments, with exception of Late_plus. Let’s do this plot again, but let’s look at the proportional mean difference between each treatment and the no spray control for each study, this should reduce variation in yield due between trials. slimmer_PM_dat %&gt;% filter(spray_management != &quot;control&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot( aes( y = prop_yield_gain, x = spray_management, fill = spray_management, colour = spray_management ) ) + geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.25) + geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.5) + labs(x = &quot;Spray management variable&quot;, y = &quot;Grain yield (t/Ha)&quot;, title = &quot;Mean grain yield from each treatment \\n categorised by spray management scenario&quot;) + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 2) + scale_fill_usq() + scale_colour_usq() + coord_flip() + guides(fill = FALSE, color = FALSE) Using the mean difference in the treatment effect seems to show the effect of each treatment better than just raw yield and reduces the variability in the treatments. We know there is a good deal of variability in our studies and between them. Mungbean produces variable yields between seasons so ordinarilly we should use a response that highlights the difference in the treatment effects that we are interested in and reduce the variability. However for an arm-based analysis we calculate the differences between control and treatment after the meta-analysis. 5.0.1 Formating the response variable Let’s inspect the response variance grain_yield.t.ha to see if it is normally distributed. In many cases a log transformation of the response variable improves the fit, due to the prevalence of log distributed data in nature. hist_usq(slimmer_PM_dat$grain_yield.t.ha, main = &quot;Grain yield (t / ha)&quot;) hist_usq(log(slimmer_PM_dat$grain_yield.t.ha), main = &quot;log(Grain yield (t / ha))&quot;) hist_usq(sqrt(slimmer_PM_dat$grain_yield.t.ha), main = &quot;sqrt(Grain yield (t / ha))&quot;) hist_usq(slimmer_PM_dat$yield_gain, main = &quot;Mean difference to control (t / ha)&quot;) The distribution of data does not seem to be improved by transformation of the data. We will retain the continuous variable grain_yield.t.ha as the response. Mean differences won’t be used as we are following the methodology of a ARM-based model, where mean differences are calculated following the meta-analysis. 5.0.2 Formatting Variance First let’s remove any entries missing variance. any(is.na(slimmer_PM_dat$yield_error)) ## [1] TRUE slimmer_PM_dat &lt;- slimmer_PM_dat[!is.na(slimmer_PM_dat$yield_error), ] slimmer_PM_dat$vi &lt;- slimmer_PM_dat$yield_error 5.0.2.1 Calculate sample variance from mean square errors Currently our data frame has the sample variance calculated earlier, however we can approximate it using the mean squared error. Let’s show the rational for our calculation and then add a secondary variance column (vi2). \\(MSE = Var + bias\\) However if our MSE was calculated from an unbiased sample we can assume \\(bias = 0\\) and therefore: \\(MSE = Var\\) To calculate the sample variance (for each treatment in the trial) from the mean square error (Trial variance) all we need to do is divide by the number of samples in each treatment. We can show this because: \\(MSE = \\frac{\\sum_{y_1}^{y_n}(y_i - \\overline{y})^2}{n - 1}\\) Where the sum of squares for the fungicide treatment estimator (\\(y\\)) is divided by the number of fungicide treatments (\\(n\\)). The sample variance is a similar formula except we use \\(x\\) instead of \\(y\\). \\(S_{Var} = \\frac{\\sum_{x_1}^{x_n}(x_i - \\overline{x})^2}{n - 1}\\) \\(x\\) being each observation within the experiment and \\(n\\) being the number of samples in the whole trial. Therefore: \\(S_{Var}\\approx\\frac{1}{n_{x}}\\frac{\\sum_{y_1}^{y_n}(y_i - \\overline{y})^2}{n_y - 1}\\) Where \\(n_x\\) is the number of samples within each treatment. #calculation when using log of response # slimmer_PM_dat$vi &lt;- # slimmer_PM_dat$Y_Msquare / (slimmer_PM_dat$n * slimmer_PM_dat$grain_yield.t.ha ^ # 2) slimmer_PM_dat$vi2 &lt;- slimmer_PM_dat$Y_Msquare / slimmer_PM_dat$n Now Let’s simplify our data by removing the control data, converting disease pressure (D_pres) to a factor and selecting only the columns of data necessary for analysis. We will also include the mean difference or response ratio grain_MD, between the treatment and control as a comparison of responses. dat1 &lt;- slimmer_PM_dat %&gt;% mutate(vi = vi/n) %&gt;% mutate(spray_management = factor( spray_management, c( &quot;control&quot;, &quot;Early&quot;, &quot;Recommended&quot;, &quot;Recommended_plus&quot;, &quot;Late&quot;, &quot;Late_plus&quot; ) ), D_pres = factor(D_pres, c(&quot;lowD&quot;, &quot;highD&quot;)), id = row_number()) %&gt;% dplyr::select( trial, trial_ref, location, year, row_spacing, host_genotype, spray_management, fungicide_ai, D_pres, grain_yield.t.ha, yield_gain, dose, vi, yield_error, vi2, n, id) 5.1 metafor analysis For the first grain yield meta-analysis, we’ll use the metafor package (Viechtbauer 2010). To do a ARM based model we will use the package metafor. We are using the spray_management variable as a moderator and an interactive term to the trial random variable.

This effectively shows the heterogeneity between experiments for these partivular treatments. The tau^2 also gives us the heterogeneity between trials and indicates Recommended_plus showed the highest heterogeneity between experiments followed by Late_plus, Late then Recommended, with Early and the no-spray control showing the least heterogeneity. The second table is in two parts (left and right). The left part, rho, is the correlation of variation between the specified treatments. All comparisons were acceptable except for a comparison between Early and Late_plus, 0.000 rho. Early and Late_plus treatments never occurred within the same trial, which is indicated by the right side of the table (hence the warning). In this result we can see that the Early treatment is not significantly different to the intercept, which in this case is the mean of the no spray control. However the other treatments are significantly different from the no-spray control (intercept). The \\(Q_M\\) omnibus test of moderators, shows the moderators significantly influence the model (\\(Q_M =\\) 31.4926475 $, df = $ 5, P &lt; 0.0001) and we can reject the null hypothesis (\\(H_0 : \\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = \\beta_3 =\\beta_4 = 0\\)) that there is no difference between the moderators (Viechtbauer 2010). The analysis shows there is still a significant amount of residual heterogeneity ($Q_E = $31.4926475 $, df = $149, P &lt; 0.0001 ) not captured by the spray management moderator indicating other possible moderators which might influence grain yield. source(&quot;R/simple_summary.R&quot;) summary(glht(PM_mv, linfct=cbind(contrMat(rep(1,6), type=&quot;Tukey&quot;))), test=adjusted(&quot;none&quot;)) ## ## Simultaneous Tests for General Linear Hypotheses ## ## Fit: rma.mv(yi = grain_yield.t.ha, V = vi, mods = ~spray_management, ## random = list(~spray_management | trial, ~1 | id), struct = &quot;UN&quot;, ## data = dat1, method = &quot;ML&quot;, control = list(optimizer = &quot;optim&quot;)) ## ## Linear Hypotheses: ## Estimate Std.

Above we can see spraying at the first sign of powdery mildew or with in 7 - 13 days after first sign is effective at mitigating yield loss. Lets test this hypothesis by adding it as a moderator and comparing the new model with the original model above.

Wilczek] is a pulse crop primarily grown in south-east Asia for human consumption as an affordable source of protein (Lambrides and Godwin 2007). The bean pod or grain can be consumed raw or added to meals after sprouting. The dried grain can also be ground into a protein enriched flour for uses in noodles, biscuits and cakes (Chankaew et al. 2013). Mungbean was first brought to Australia in the 1930s for use as a forage or green manure crop. However, it was only somewhat recently, the 1960s that mungbean was grown commercially (Lawn and Russell 1978; Chauhan and Williams 2018). Prior to the 1970s the total area grown in Australia rarely exceeded 1000 hectares (Lawn and Russell 1978). At the end of the 1980s, between 3,000 to 10,0000 hectares were being harvested for dried beans in Australia, of which mungbean is categorised by the FAO statistics data repository (Food and United Nations. 2020). In the decade leading up to 2018 between 35 - 86.4 thousand hectares of dried beans were planted annually. This increase is attributed high value export markets and to the improved yields in the new cultivars (Clarry 2016). Currently mungbean is predominantly grown in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales as a short season summer legume crop. In 2019, approximately 90 % of Australian mungbean was grown for export with lucrative returns of up to $1300 AU a tonne (Government 2019). Mungbean potentially yields up to 3 tonnes per hectare (Thomas et al. 2004), but due to high variability in yields between seasons and locations, the average Australian farm still yields less than 1 tonne per hectare (Chauhan and Williams 2018). The high variability in yields, in part, can be attributed to a range of diseases that affect the crop (Kelly et al. 2017). Two major foliar diseases, tan spot or common wilt (Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens) and halo blight (Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. phaseolicola), are the main focus of the Australian Mungbean Improvement programme’s resistance breeding efforts due to lack of effective chemical controls for them. While a third disease, powdery mildew, can reduce yields by up to 40% (Chankaew et al. 2013) in susceptible cultivars, the damage can be mitigated through an integrated disease management strategy of fungicide treatments and cultural practices. Powdery mildew is caused by two separate genera of fungi in Australia Podosphaera xanthii and an unnamed Psuedoidium sp. (Kiss and Kelly Personal Communication). While the pathogens are obligate parasites, secondary hosts that allow the pathogens to over-season between mungbean crops have not yet been identified. The disease lifecycle can be as short as five days for a germinating conidia to infect the host and produce new reproductive structures, conidiophores, which produce more conidia which disseminate to new infection sites (Sparks and Kelly 2017). Weather conditions that favour the rapid development of the disease are cool temperatures between 22° and 26°C, and a leaf surface that is not overly wet for infection (Kelly et al. 2017). Due to the requirement for cooler temperatures for infection, planting date is an effective strategy for preventing the development of powdery mildew in mungbean (“Planting mungbeans” n.d.). In southern Queensland and northern New South Wales, sowing dates between late spring (November) and mid-summer (January) are advised to avoid the conducive cooler autumn temperatures, which normally commence in March. Therefore, a delayed sowing date of late January into February increases the possibility powdery mildew will infect earlier in the crop development cycle and cause greater yield losses than in earlier sown mungbean crops. Cultivar selection is an additional strategy to mitigate yield damage from powdery mildew. In Australia, quantitative resistance to powdery mildew has also been incorporated into few commercially available varieties. Jade-AU has the the best disease resistance to powdery mildew (moderately susceptible), with cv. Green Diamond also containing some notable resistance (Sparks and Kelly 2017). However commercially available mungbean cultivars in Australia lack sufficient resistance to be used as the primary powdery mildew management strategy. Evidence of this is shown by the 2016 field trials with the moderately susceptible cultivar, Jade-AU, where yield losses of up to 32.7 % were recorded (Thompson 2016). Quantitative disease resistance has been observed in some breeding lines overseas (Pandey et al. 2018; Chankaew et al. 2013), however no evidence for how they compare to Australian varietal resistance could be found. Additional strategies to cultivar choice, such as fungicide treatments, are necessary to limit yield loss when conditions for the disease are conducive. There is almost a complete lack of peer-reviewed literature summarising fungicide efficacy on powdery mildew in Australian mungbean. Much of the experimental work has been published by funding agencies and state government extension departments as extension bulletins or other related type materials. Past field trials in eastern Australia have tested a range of fungicide active ingredients while also attempting to evaluate the best application time for the highest efficacy (alliance 2013a, 2013d, 2013c, 2013b; Thompson 2016; Kelly et al. 2017; Thompson et al. 2016). Early trials showed that for fungicide applications to protect yield, a single fungicide application at first sign of the disease with another follow-up application two weeks later, if necessary, was the most effective (Thompson 2016; Sparks and Kelly 2017). However due to the variability in the results between seasons and experiments few of these studies produced a clear result based on a statistical analysis. This variability presents uncertainty for the best practice of fungicide spray schedules to mitigate yield losses from powdery mildew. . The collection of experiments mentioned above and other unpublished trials present an excellent opportunity for a meta-analysis. Meta-analyses are statistical tools which can analyse a collection of experiments, which have a similar aim, and produces a more accurate estimate of the true effect being measured. Using a meta-analysis can be useful in situations like this where several studies exist, that have the same objective but may not provide a clear answer to the question due to variation in the results within the individual studies. The outcome of a meta-analysis provides a more accurate estimation of the true treatments effect, because it considers the amount of variance in each study and weights the influence of each studies treatment effects according to it’s statistical accuracy. Typically meta-analyses consider the effect of a single treatment against a control group across multiple independent studies (Madden and Paul 2011). However meta-analyses can also consider effect differences between multiple treatments and a control group, these are called multi-variate or network meta-analyses (Madden, Piepho, and Paul 2016). Multi-variate meta-analyses are particularly useful when there are no direct comparisons between two treatments in any of the included studies. In-direct comparisons can be made between these two treatments if the both had direct comparisons with one or more treatments in common, assuming no significant bias in the studies which investigated each of the treatments which are subject to a indirect comparison (Jansen et al. 2011). Considering the recent launch in 2019 of the decision support system (DSS) PowderyMildewMBM (Diggle n.d.), which provides a cost benefit analysis to assists growers in their decision ‘if’ and ‘when’ apply fungicide; a meta-analysis to evaluate and verify the best fungicide spray schedule seemed prudent. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine, from a collection of unpublished studies, what spray management scenario provides the greatest yield protection from powdery mildew in Australian mungbean. 8.2 Materials and Methods The data for this study were obtained from through personal correspondence with colleagues and collaborating institutions. Trials undertaken in the 2013 season were conducted by the Northern Growers Alliance (NGA) (alliance 2013a, 2013d, 2013c, 2013b). The most recent trials starting from 2015 were undertaken by the University of Southern Queensland (USQ) with the assistance of Queensland DAF from 2015 to 2019. Trial data were in different formats with varying levels of information. Some trials we obtained the raw data others the reported means of each treatment, with all but one study reporting some form of variance along with the mean. Twenty six trials in total were collated. To ensure the correct question was asked of the analysis the data needed to conform to a strict criteria. The criteria for inclusion of trial data in the meta-analysis required, a field trial testing fungicide efficacy for powdery mildew control on mungbean in the Grains Research and Development (GRDC) northern grains regions of eastern Australia, which grows the majority of Australia’s summer crops. Trial data had to include: the date when powdery mildew was first observed; disease incidence at the end of the growing season; fungicide application dates; the fungicide active ingredients; fungicide dose; and crop yield. The data were subset to only include treatments with the same mode of action; demethylase inhibitor (DMI) fungicides, tebuconazole and propiconazole were thus retained in the dataset. Subsequently the 26 trials were reduced to 16 using the same fungicide doses (Table 1). Details of trial data are presented within a research compendium which was prepared to supplement this publication []. With only a small number of trials, and to increase the replication, we made no distinction between the tebuconazole and propiconazole in the analysis. All trials included in this analysis were randomised complete block designs and not previously published in peer-reviewed literature. While the main aim of all the trials collected for this study were to assess the efficacy of fungicide for control of powdery mildew, some trials tested additional variables in the experimental design. These additional variables included: row spacing, fungicide active ingredient, fungicide dose, planting date, number of fungicide applications and cultivar. To account for the variation attributed to some of these variables between trials, and the treatments within trials, a single ‘trial’ factor was created to describe the main variables; a trial reference code, trial location, trial season, host genotype, row spacing, and fungicide dose. Most of the studies which were used in this analysis assessed powdery mildew incidence on a 1 – 9 ordinal scale (Table 2). However, the 2013 NGA trials (Table 1) reported incidence as the percentage of leaves covered by powdery mildew and the location of the infected leaves in the canopy; lower, middle or upper canopy. Given the ordinal scale ranked plants on the percent of foliage up the plant showing the disease, a conversion to mean plot incidence on the ordinal 1 – 9 scale was straight-forward. The timing of fungicide application treatments, was defined in relation to the recorded date when powdery mildew first occurred in the trial. An ‘Early’ fungicide application treatment, referred to a fungicide spray schedule that commenced the first spray prior to the disease being observed in the trial. ‘Recommended’ refers to a fungicide spray schedule which commences following the first sign of disease, within three days. ‘Late’ treatments commence between 7 - 13 days after the first sign of disease. The number of fungicide applications were binned in to two categories. A spray schedule with a single spray, and a spray schedule with two or three spray applications (Plus). The division of the treatments categorised: 13 ‘Early’ treatments; 5 ‘EarlyPlus’, 32 ‘Recommended’; 46 ‘RecommendedPlus’; 17 ‘Late’; and 20 ‘LatePlus. ’EarlyPlus’ treatments were removed from the subsequent meta-analysis, due to an insufficient sample size. What remained was the mean yield for total of 173 treatments in the following five spray schedule categories: no spray control, single early spray, single recommended spray, recommended with multiple sprays, single late spray, and late with multiple sprays. A categorical disease pressure factor was created by binning trials based on the mean AUDPC of the no spray control plot into two levels: ‘low disease pressure’ or ‘high disease pressure’. The two levels were separated via the median AUDPC (153.625) of the no spray control plots. Mean grain yields for each treatment were either obtained directly from trial reports, or calculated from the raw data when available. The sample variance was calculated from the raw data when available or the least squares statistic in trial reports. Sample variance for the 2012 Kingaroy study was calculated from the reported least squares statistic using a T-critical value of 1.697 and the approach reported in Ngugi et al. (2011). The T-critical value was determined from the 30 degrees of freedom and probability of \\(a = 0.1\\) using a t-distribution table. The 2012 Gatton and 2015 Emerald trials reported treatment means without accompanying variance and were thus removed from the dataset prior to the analysis. This analysis uses response ratio, or means difference (MD) as the response variable. MD were chosen to reduce the inherent variability between trials due to location and seasonal effects on grain yields by assessing the effect of fungicide spray schedule on the difference between the treatments and no spray control plot. \\(MD = {Y_i-\\overline{Y_c}}\\) (Higgins and Green 2011) Where \\(Y_i\\) is the treatment mean, \\(Y_c\\) is the no spray control treatment mean . Similar to Paul et. al. (2007), we fitted a multivariate random effects model \\(Y_i \\sim N(\\mu,s_i^2 + \\sigma^2)\\) where \\(Y_i\\) is the response, a vector of the MD grain yield for each treatment in the \\(i\\)th trial over total number (\\(K\\)) of trials(\\(i\\) = 1, …\\(K\\)). \\(Y_i\\) is estimated from a normal distribution with the mean \\(\\mu\\), sample variance of \\(Si_^2\\) and a between trial variance of \\(\\sigma^2\\). Moderator variables. The random effects meta-analysis was expanded to evaluate if the residual heterogeneity could be explained by spray schedule (\\(SPRAY_{Sched}\\)). SpraySchedule was assigned as an inside factor to the outside factor trial to provide correlated random effects between the different SpraySchedule treatments within trials. The intercept was omitted from the model so each treatment would be reported against zero, which represents the control mean. Linear contrasts were used to compare the mean effect sizes between each spray schedule treatment and their respective standard errors and confidence intervals. Additional meta-analysis models tested variables … for their influence on the SpraySchedule variables ability to mitigate yield loss. For the variable disease pressure a Wald-type test was used to test the impact of this variable on the model as a whole. The data were analysed in the R statistical software environment, version 4.0.1, (Team 2020) using two contributed meta-analysis packages, metafor, version 2-4.0, (Viechtbauer 2010) and netmeta, version 1.2-1, (Rücker et al. 2020).

Treatments which incorporating multiple fungicide applications, RecommendedPlus and LatePlus produced the highest mean yield protection estimates at 196.4 (SE = 48.7 kg / ha) and 219.9 kg / ha (SE = 47.4 kg / ha) respectively (Table 3). Both RecommendedPlus and LatePlus were also significantly higher than single applications starting Early (P = 0.008 and P = 0.003 respectively) and Late(P = 0.05 and P = 0.03 respectively). However, comparing LatePlus and Early should done with caution given these treatments did not occur within the same trial for any of the 15 trials included in the meta-analysis. Within the single fungicide application treatments Recommended provided the highest yield protection, and was estimated at saving an average of 159.9 kg / ha (SE = 30.5 kg / ha) relative to the no spray control (P &lt; 0.0001). Recommended treatments were was also significantly higher than Early treatments by 122.1 kg / ha (SE = 42.1 kg / ha)(P = 0.004). Single Late applications were effective at significantly mitigating the effect of powdery mildew on yield by a mean of 122 kg / ha (SE = 39.2 kg / ha)(P = 0.0019). However, this estimate was not significantly different to single Early or Recommended treatments (P = 0.119; P = 0.278 respectively). The \\(Q_M\\) omnibus test of moderators, shows the moderators significantly influence the model (\\(Q_M = 26.22, df = 5, p &lt; 0.0001\\)) and we can reject the null hypothesis (\\(H_0 : \\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = \\beta_3 =\\beta_4 = 0\\)) that there is no difference between the moderators (Viechtbauer 2010). The analysis shows there is still a significant amount of residual heterogeneity (\\(Q_E = 568.31, df = 111, p &lt; 0.0001\\)) not captured by the spray management moderator indicating other possible moderators, which might influence grain yield. A log-ratio test, based on a chi-squared distribution, indicated that retaining the SpraySchedule variable as a random interactive term provided a significantly better model (P = 0.0179). An inspection of log-likelihood profile plots showed the model, for each random interactive term, provided a reasonable estimate of \\(\\tau^2\\), with no indication the variables were over-fit. While the addition of disease pressure, as an interactive moderator term to SpraySchedule, did explain slightly more residual heterogeneity, shown by a lower \\(Q_E = 409.91,\\). The model including disease pressure did not significantly improve the model (P = 0.4859) and did not significantly explain differences in the SpraySchedule term, and therefore disease pressure was not included in the final model.

This meta-analysis confirms that advice, by showing that applying the first fungicide application, within three days of first sign will significantly mitigate yield loss from powdery mildew by between 35.85 to 154.78 kg / ha (\\(Recommended\\), P = 0.0017). In addition, spray schedules which commenced ‘late’, up to 13 days after first sign of the disease were still effective at mitigating yield loss by 53.27 to 172.6 kg / ha (\\(Late\\),P = 0.0002). Spray schedules which included follow-up fungicide applications were on average more effective at reducing yield loss due to powdery mildew by; 94.87 to 257.24 kg / ha in the \\(RecommendedPlus\\) treatments (P &lt; 0.0001) and 64.1 to 229.16 kg / ha in the \\(LatePlus\\) treatments (P = 0.0005) (Figure 1) which again follows the advice given by Thompson et. al (Thompson 2016). This meta-analysis adds certainty to the advice which is currently given to growers, especially around any uncertainty that Early sprays might be effective at suppressing the disease. We show here Early fungicide applications, which were made prior to any sign of the disease, were not effective at mitigating yield loss. This meta-analysis also provides a effective spray window for fungicide applications, given that spray schedules which commenced ‘late’ were still significantly effective at mitigating yield loss (\\(Late\\) P = 0.0002) 7 - 13 days after the first sign of disease. Growers typically do not have the time to inspect their crop regularly for the first sign of powdery mildew and therefore the disease may not be spotted within the first couple of days of it establishing. Also, weather conditions and logistical issues might prevent growers from getting machinery in the paddock to treat the disease immediately after it is spotted. These issues, and perhaps other on farm duties, might delay a timely application, permitting the disease more time to establish. Knowing a delay of up to two weeks may not lead to yield losses, can allow growers to incorporate other integrated pest management options, such as insecticide, with the fungicide spray saving on spray application costs. However attention should be made to the label requirements when first planning a spray schedule. Second applications, if they are needed, should be applied at least 10 - 14 days after the first application and not within 21 days of harvest (“Permit to allow minor use of an AgVet chemical product for the control of powdery mildew in adzuji beans, mung beans and navy beans.” n.d.). If time permitted a second spray after the first ‘late’ application, on average the meta-analysis shows this would be optimal, as the \\(LatePlus\\) treatment significantly limited yield loss by 97.8 kg / ha, when compared to the \\(Late\\), single spray treatment P = 0.0283. It is important to note, the studies included in this meta-analysis may not reflect a ‘normal’ mungbean season. All the included experiments were intentionally sown late in the season, from January through to as late as early March, to ensure powdery mildew infection (Figure 1). While certain circumstances may force growers to sow mungbeans late, many may decide to fallow their fields instead of risking a powdery mildew epidemics and an early frost damaging the crop and yields. Regardless, according to the Australian Mungbean Association sowing guide (“Planting mungbeans” n.d.), mungbeans should not be sown later than January in the Darling Downs, the region where the majority of trials were undertaken. If the planting guide is adhered to the mungbean would be at a lower risk of powdery mildew, reducing the requirement for fungicide applications. An example of this is if we inspect the six trials which powdery mildew manifested 60 days or greater after planting (Trial references: AM1304, mung1819/01, mung1011/01, AM1303, AM1305 and BB1305). Of these trials, four directly compared single \\(Recommended\\) fungicide applications and \\(RecommendedPlus\\) (AM1303, AM1305, BB1305 and mung1819/01), two of which (AM1305 and mung1819/01) produced at least one treatment \\(RecommendedPlus\\) treatment with a higher grain yield the \\(Recommended\\) treatments. However, neither AM1305 or mung1819/01 neither contained \\(Recommended\\) or \\(RecommendedPlus\\) treatments with higher mean yields than the no-spray control. This indicating there is likely no benefit to applying two fungicide applications when the disease manifests later than 60 days into the growing season. Further the trials undertaken in 2013, such as Premer (AM1303), Goolhi (AM1305) Marys Mount (AM1304) and Millmerran (BB1305) reported a significant difference in powdery mildew severity between the fungicide treatments, however neither trial showed a significant difference in grain yield between treatments (alliance 2013c, @premer2013, @Marysmount2013, @goolhi2013). Therefore, discretion is still required for if fungicide applications are necessary given the crop growth stage and forecast weather conditions. The PowderyMildewMBM considers crop growth stage and weather, to assist decision making whether to spray or not to spray (Diggle n.d.). PowderyMildewMBM also provides a cost-benefit analysis to growers for fungicide spray schedule scenarios. The user inputs weather, crop, and economic inputs into the DSS and the application returns the probability that one or two fungicide sprays would protect yields sufficiently to increase the net profit. The scope of the meta-analysis is limited to the timing of fungicide application and therefore we can’t validate all the variables available in PowderyMildewMBM. However our results validate the decision of the app developers not to recommend prophylactic fungicide applications. If the powdery mildew is not observed in the crop the app advises the user to keep monitoring for disease. Scouting the crop for powdery mildew might not be necessary during the warmer months of the season. Data from the trials included in this experiment show regardless of crop sowing date, powdery mildew establishes on average in the month of March which marks the beginning of Autumn (Figure 1). Considering the results of the meta-analysis, weekly inspections would be ideal to ensure timely fungicide applications if necessary. Scouting at intervals greater than 12 - 13 days, might risk crop losses if a spray schedule does not commence within aforementioned the spray window. More work is needed to understand when ‘late’ fungicide applications are too late. We estimate the costs of applying tebuconazole fungicide at $4.18 AUD / ha, if fungicide is purchased at $15 / L (Simpfendorfer and Taylor 2011) and applications cost are \\(2 per hectare [@QueenslandGovernment2019]. The meta-analysis estimates average yield savings of between kg / ha (\\)Recommended\\() and kg / ha (\\)RecommendedPlus$). These average yield savings would save $ AUD / ha for a single application at first sign and AUD / ha if a follow-up application is made. Lucrative returns such as these may tempt growers into applying fungicide to control diseases such as powdery mildew when they are unnecessary. Excessive use of fungicides are highly likely to lead ongoing problems such as fungicide resistance. Podosphaera xanthii is categorised by the Australian Fungicide resistance Action Committee (FRAC) as a ‘High risk’ candidate to evolve fungicide resistance (FRAC 2019). Evolution of fungicide resistance can occur quickly, especially when spray schedules are not designed with potential fungicide resistance in mind. Powdery mildew is one such group of fungal pathogens with an extensive track record of rapidly developing fungicide resistance. In cucurbits, P. xanthii evolved resistance to benzimidazole within three years of its registration (Peterson 1973) and has evolved resistance to numerous fungicide classes, such as benzimidazoles, demethylation inhibitors, organophosphates, hydroxypyrimidines, quinone inhibitors and quinoxalines since (Mcgrath 2001). In cereal crops Blumeria graminis showed reduced sensitivity to strobilurins in 1998, two years after the fungicides began being used in Europe (Chin et al. 2001). According to the Fungicide resistance Action Committee (FRAC) it is important to alternate or mix fungicides with different modes of action to avoid fungicide resistance. At the time of writing, in Australia one fungicide is registered with the to treat powdery mildew in mungbean, Veritas/Custodia (200 g/L tebuconazole with 120 g/L azoxystrobin). This fungicide provides dual action: tebeconazole disrupts C-14 demethylase, required in sterol biosynthesis for cell membranes; and azoxystrobin, a Quinone outside inhibitor. Quinone is required in cell metabolism and active in the mitochondrial complex III. However FRAC recommends that applications of QoIs or strobilurins, singularly or as a mixture, should not be applied consecutively and alternated with a fungicide from a different group (Brent and Hollomon 2007). For mungbean, past experiments have shown some success with sulphur applications to control powdery mildew. Sulphur is a non-systemic protectant and thus provides an excellent option for rotation to limit the emergence of fungicide resistance. To extend the time that a fungicide remains effective against the target pathogen, strategic use of the fungicide must be considered. Excessive fungicide sprays by a single active increase the selection pressure on the pathogen to evolve resistance (Brent and Hollomon 2007). If any strains of the pathogen with resistance to the fungicide are present in a population regular use of the fungicide will increase it’s proportion in the population. Therefore, managing the disease with fungicides for the highest economic return is likely not to require eradication of the causal pathogen. Integrated pest management practices focus on using only the required number of chemical control to protect the economic return. These strategies permit the presence of yield limiting diseases and pests if intervening would cost more than the economic return of protection. Advising use of fungicide for disease control to protect yields should also consider the harm it may do to symbiotic relationships with microbiota. While some nitrogen fixing symbiont show a level of tolerance to fungicides, all are detrimentally affected by increasing concentrations of fungicide leading to lower nodulation and biomass accumulation (???). Therefore if a grower is relying on rhizobia inoculation to help meet the crops nitrogen requirements, untimely and excessive applications of a systemic fungicide for powdery mildew control may actually reduce yields. 8.4.1 Future work This meta-analysis provides a ballast for the direction of future powdery mildew research in mungbean. However it does not provide enough certainty to when late fungicide applications would be too late to protect yield losses due to the disease. Future experiments should take note of physiological maturity of the crop throughout the season so ‘crop age’ might be considered as a covariate in future analyses. In cases where mungbean physiological maturity may not have been recorded the APSIM mungbean module (???). Early detection of powdery mildew is vital for an effective fungicidal control response. Data from the collection of 26 studies in the Northern Grain region, indicate powdery mildew is likely to manifest on crops in the first month of autumn. This data together with additional observations may permit models to predict the likely onset of the disease given weather parameters, providing an early warning system for growers to scout their crop for signs of powdery mildew. However an improved understanding of the pathogen biology is also needed to ensure models are as accurate as they can be. The population genetics, epidemiology and alternate hosts are all poorly understood in this host-pathogen relationship. The recent discovery of a second powdery mildew species which infects mungbean highlights the paucity of knowledge on this disease. 8.5 Acknowledgments The authors wish to acknowledge the work done by Professor Malcolm Riley and Dr Sue Thompson whom undertook many of the trials incorporated in this analysis from 2004 - 2015.
