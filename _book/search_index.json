Paul Melloy, Emerson Del Ponte and Adam H. Sparks 16 June, 2020 1 Home This compendium details the statistical analysis and methods while undertaking a meta-analysis of fungicide efficacy trials for control of powdery mildew in mungbean. This meta-analysis will focus on the main aim of determining: When is the optimum time to spray fungicide to limit the effect of powdery mildew on mungbean yields? 1.1 Contents This compendia is broken down into seven sections: Details of the experiments which were included in the analysis. Preliminary data exploration which investigates possible variables that could influence the meta-analysis. Fungicides Mungbean cultivar Row spacing Rainfall When conditions become suitable for powdery mildew infection Preparation of data for the meta-analysis Meta-analysis of the effect of fungicide spray scheduale on yield loss Meta-analysis of the effect of fungicide spray scheduale on disease severity and yield loss Manuscript Wireframe Manuscript: A meta-analysis of fungicide use in mungbean to control for yield loss due to powdery mildew. 1.2 Other research questions which are not the focus of this study How has the first sign of powdery mildew changed over the seasons and between experimental sites? Is there an ideal planting time, or fungicide management strategy, which could make use of powdery mildew defoliation during pod maturation resulting in an increased yield? Do infections that occur before flowering increase the probable yield loss? What is the length of a mungbean season and how has it varied in this trial? This data has not been collected or is not accurate enough to be useful to answer this question. 1.3 Possible sources of variation in this analysis. Variability among host genotypes. The probable influence of season might be influenced by host genotype. This is because newer varieties were adopted into experimental trials as they were released. Between 2001 and 2015 mungbean genotype changed from Green Diamond, Berken, Crystal to Jade. Jade was the only cultivar used between 2015 and 2019. Estimations of plant maturity stages over each growing season. These estimations might able to be computed using APSIM. "]
